Identifying the genetic defect in individuals with the disease represents a significant challenge because the gene is extremely large with a high incidence of sporadic mutations across the entire gene ranging from single nucleotide substitutes to large deletions. In the present study, we have used a combination of techniques (heteroduplex analysis, sequencing, loss of heterozygosity and quantification of gene dosage) to define the genetic defect in 68 individuals from a cohort of 107 NF1 Taiwanese patients of Chinese origin. Fifty-eight were initially identified using heteroduplex analytical techniques and confirmed by sequence analysis. A further five were identified by direct sequence analysis alone. The reminders were shown to carry large deletions in the NF1 gene by demonstrating loss of heterozygosity that was confirmed by gene dosage measurements using quantitative-PCR techniques. Mis-sense, non-sense, frame-shift or splice-site mutations were identified across the entire gene of which the majority (45/68) were novel in nature. The detection rate with the various analytical techniques and the types of mutation detected are consistent with published data involving both individuals and large cohort studies from other ethnic backgrounds."

Dermal neurofibromas may cause local discomfort and itching but are rarely associated with neurological deficit and do not undergo malignant change. The more extensive plexiform neurofibromas produce neurological complications in 27%-43% of patients with NF1 and may undergo malignant degeneration in 5% of cases. Patients with NF1 who develop pain or new neurological symptoms should have a rapid and thorough assessment for malignancy.

Similarities between neurofibromatosis type 1 and Noonan syndrome have been noted for over 20 years and patients who share symptoms of both conditions are often given the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS). The molecular basis of these combined phenotypes was poorly understood and controversially discussed over several decades until the discovery that the syndromes are related through disturbances of the Ras pathway. We present an infant male with coarse facial features, severe supravalvar pulmonic stenosis, automated atrial tachycardia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, airway compression, severe neurological involvement, and multiple complications that lead to death during early infancy. The severity of clinical presentation and significant dysmorphic features suggested the possibility of a double genetic disorder in the Ras pathway instead of NFNS. Molecular analysis showed a missense mutation in exon 25 of the NF1 gene (4288A>G, p.N1430D) and a pathogenic mutation on exon 8 (922A>G, p.N308D) of the PTPN11 gene. Cardiovascular disease has been well described in patients with Noonan syndrome with PTPN11 mutations but the role of haploinsufficiency for neurofibromin in the heart development and function is not yet well understood. Our case suggests that a double genetic defect resulting in the hypersignaling of the Ras pathway may lead to complex cardiovascular abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, refractory arrhythmia, severe neurological phenotype, and early death."

The molecular basis of NF1 tumorigenesis is, however, still unclear. Ninety-one tumors from 31 NF1 patients were screened for gross changes in the NF1 gene using microsatellite/restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers; loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was found in 17 out of 91 (19%) tumors (including two out of seven MPNSTs). Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was then used to screen 43 LOH-negative and 10 LOH-positive tumors for NF1 microlesions at both RNA and DNA levels. Thirteen germline and 12 somatic mutations were identified, of which three germline (IVS7-2A>G, 3731delT, 6117delG) and eight somatic (1888delG, 4374-4375delCC, R2129S, 2088delG, 2341del18, IVS27b-5C>T, 4083insT, Q519P) were novel. A mosaic mutation (R2429X) was also identified in a neurofibroma by DHPLC analysis and cloning/sequencing. The observed somatic and germline mutational spectra were similar in terms of mutation type, relative frequency of occurrence, and putative underlying mechanisms of mutagenesis. Tumors lacking mutations were screened for NF1 gene promoter hypermethylation but none were found. Microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis revealed MSI in five out of 11 MPNSTs as compared to none out of 70 neurofibromas (p=1.8 x 10(-5)). The screening of seven MPNSTs for subtle mutations in the CDKN2A and TP53 genes proved negative, although the screening of 11 MPNSTs detected LOH involving either the TP53 or the CDKN2A gene in a total of four tumors. These findings are consistent with the view that NF1 tumorigenesis is a complex multistep process involving a variety of different types of genetic defect at multiple loci."

The region of DNA located between two translocation breakpoints has been cloned and a DNA sequence encoding a 11-13 kb mRNA identified. That this sequence shows deletions and point mutations in NF1 affected individuals and not in normal controls provides strong evidence that it is indeed the NF1 gene.

FUS is a predominantly nuclear DNA- and RNA-binding protein that is involved in RNA processing. Large FUS-immunoreactive inclusions fill the perikaryon of surviving motor neurons of ALS patients carrying mutations at post-mortem. This sequestration of FUS is predicted to disrupt RNA processing and initiate neurodegeneration. Here, we demonstrate that C-terminal ALS mutations disrupt the nuclear localizing signal (NLS) of FUS resulting in cytoplasmic accumulation in transfected cells and patient fibroblasts. FUS mislocalization is rescued by the addition of the wild-type FUS NLS to mutant proteins. We also show that oxidative stress recruits mutant FUS to cytoplasmic stress granules where it is able to bind and sequester wild-type FUS. While FUS interacts with itself directly by protein-protein interaction, the recruitment of FUS to stress granules and interaction with PABP are RNA dependent. These findings support a two-hit hypothesis, whereby cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS protein, followed by cellular stress, contributes to the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates that may sequester FUS, disrupt RNA processing and initiate motor neuron degeneration."

Fus is not required for APC-RNP localization but is required for efficient translation of associated transcripts. Labeling of newly synthesized proteins revealed that Fus promotes translation preferentially within protrusions. Mutations in Fus cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the mutant protein forms inclusions that appear to correspond to stress granules. We show that overexpression or mutation of Fus results in formation of granules, which preferentially recruit APC-RNPs. Remarkably, these granules are not translationally silent. Instead, APC-RNP transcripts are translated within cytoplasmic Fus granules. These results unexpectedly show that translation can occur within stress-like granules.

In cultured cells, FUS variants with disease-associated amino acid substitutions or short deletions affecting nuclear localization signal (NLS) and causing cytoplasmic mislocalization can be sequestered into stress granules (SGs). We demonstrated that disruption of motifs responsible for RNA recognition and binding not only prevents SG recruitment, but also dramatically increases the protein propensity to aggregate in the cell cytoplasm with formation of juxtanuclear structures displaying typical features of aggresomes. Functional RNA-binding domains from TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) fused to highly aggregation-prone C-terminally truncated FUS protein restored the ability to enter SGs and prevented aggregation of the chimeric protein. Truncated FUS was also able to trap endogenous FUS molecules in the cytoplasmic aggregates.

Not only are mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 associated with ALS and FTLD, but this protein is also a major constituent of pathological intracellular inclusions in these diseases. Recent studies have significantly expanded our understanding of TDP-43 physiology. TDP-43 is now known to play important roles in neuronal RNA metabolism. It binds to and regulates the splicing and stability of numerous RNAs encoding proteins involved in neuronal development, synaptic function and neurodegeneration. Thus, a loss of these essential functions is an attractive hypothesis regarding the role of TDP-43 in neurodegeneration. Moreover, TDP-43 is an aggregation-prone protein and, given the role of toxic protein aggregates in neurodegeneration, a toxic gain-of-function mechanism is another rational hypothesis. Importantly, ALS related mutations modulate the propensity of TDP-43 to aggregate in cell culture. Several recent studies have documented that cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates co-localize with stress granule markers. Stress granules are cytoplasmic inclusions that repress translation of a subset of RNAs in times of cellular stress, and several proteins implicated in neurodegeneration (i.e. Ataxin-2 and SMN) interact with stress granules. Thus, understanding the interplay between TDP-43 aggregation, stress granules and the effect of ALS-associated TDP-43 mutations may be the key to understanding the role of TDP-43 in neurodegeneration. We propose two models of TDP-43 aggregate formation. The \"independent model\" stipulates that TDP-43 aggregation is independent of stress granule formation, in contrast to the \"precursor model\" which presents the idea that stress granule formation contributes to a TDP-43 aggregate \"seed\" and that chronic stress leads to concentration-dependent TDP-43 aggregation.

Several genes, including SOD1, TDP-43, FUS, Ubiquilin 2, C9orf72 and Profilin 1, have been linked with the sporadic and familiar forms of ALS. FUS is a DNA/RNA-binding protein (RBP) that forms cytoplasmic inclusions in ALS and frontotemporal lobular degeneration (FTLD) patients' brains and spinal cords. However, it is unknown whether the RNA-binding ability of FUS is required for causing ALS pathogenesis. Here, we exploited a Drosophila model of ALS and neuronal cell lines to elucidate the role of the RNA-binding ability of FUS in regulating FUS-mediated toxicity, cytoplasmic mislocalization and incorporation into stress granules (SGs). To determine the role of the RNA-binding ability of FUS in ALS, we mutated FUS RNA-binding sites (F305L, F341L, F359L, F368L) and generated RNA-binding-incompetent FUS mutants with and without ALS-causing mutations (R518K or R521C). We found that mutating the aforementioned four phenylalanine (F) amino acids to leucines (L) (4F-L) eliminates FUS RNA binding. We observed that these RNA-binding mutations block neurodegenerative phenotypes seen in the fly brains, eyes and motor neurons compared with the expression of RNA-binding-competent FUS carrying ALS-causing mutations. Interestingly, RNA-binding-deficient FUS strongly localized to the nucleus of Drosophila motor neurons and mammalian neuronal cells, whereas FUS carrying ALS-linked mutations was distributed to the nucleus and cytoplasm. Importantly, we determined that incorporation of mutant FUS into the SG compartment is dependent on the RNA-binding ability of FUS. In summary, we demonstrate that the RNA-binding ability of FUS is essential for the neurodegenerative phenotype in vivo of mutant FUS (either through direct contact with RNA or through interactions with other RBPs)."

Furthermore, treatment with salubrinal, an inhibitor of dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2-\u03b1, a key modulator of ER stress, potentiates ER stress-mediated SG formation. Inclusions of C-terminal fragment TDP-43, reminiscent of disease-pathology, form in close association with ER and Golgi compartments, further indicating the involvement of ER dysfunction in TDP-43-associated disease. Consistent with this notion, over-expression of ALS-linked mutant TDP-43, and to a lesser extent wildtype TDP-43, triggers several ER stress pathways in neuroblastoma cells. Similarly, we found an interaction between the ER chaperone protein disulphide isomerase and TDP-43 in transfected cell lysates and in the spinal cords of mutant A315T TDP-43 transgenic mice.

We quantify the association of TDP-43 with stress granules over time and show that stress granule association and size are dependent on the glycine-rich region of TDP-43, which harbors the majority of pathogenic mutations. Moreover, we establish that cells harboring wild-type and mutant TDP-43 have distinct stress responses: mutant TDP-43 forms significantly larger stress granules, and is incorporated into stress granules earlier, than wild-type TDP-43; in striking contrast, wild-type TDP-43 forms more stress granules over time, but the granule size remains relatively unchanged.

Although TDP-43 has been shown to interact with translation factors, its role in protein synthesis remains unclear, and no in vivo translation targets have been reported to date. Here we provide evidence that TDP-43 associates with futsch mRNA in a complex and regulates its expression at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in Drosophila. In the context of TDP-43-induced proteinopathy, there is a significant reduction of futsch mRNA at the NMJ compared with motor neuron cell bodies where we find higher levels of transcript compared with controls. TDP-43 also leads to a significant reduction in Futsch protein expression at the NMJ. Polysome fractionations coupled with quantitative PCR experiments indicate that TDP-43 leads to a futsch mRNA shift from actively translating polysomes to nontranslating ribonuclear protein particles, suggesting that in addition to its effect on localization, TDP-43 also regulates the translation of futsch mRNA. We also show that futsch overexpression is neuroprotective by extending life span, reducing TDP-43 aggregation, and suppressing ALS-like locomotor dysfunction as well as NMJ abnormalities linked to microtubule and synaptic stabilization. Furthermore, the localization of MAP1B, the mammalian homolog of Futsch, is altered in ALS spinal cords in a manner similar to our observations in Drosophila motor neurons. Together, our results suggest a microtubule-dependent mechanism in motor neuron disease caused by TDP-43-dependent alterations in futsch mRNA localization and translation in vivo."

Wild-type FUS is mostly localized in the nuclei of neurons, but the ALS mutants are partly mislocalized in the cytoplasm and can form inclusions. We demonstrate that the C-terminal 32 amino acid residues of FUS constitute an effective nuclear localization sequence (NLS) as it targeted beta-galactosidase (LacZ, 116 kDa) to the nucleus. Deletion of or the ALS mutations within the NLS caused cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS. Moreover, we identified the poly-A binding protein (PABP1), a stress granule marker, as an interacting partner of FUS. Large PABP1-positive cytoplasmic foci (i.e. stress granules) colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions but were absent in wild-type FUS-expressing cells. Processing bodies, which are functionally related to stress granules, were adjacent to but not colocalized with the mutant FUS inclusions. Our results suggest that the ALS mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism."

We show that a non-classical PY nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the C-terminus of FUS is necessary for nuclear import. The majority of fALS-associated mutations occur within the NLS and impair nuclear import to a degree that correlates with the age of disease onset. This presents the first case of disease-causing mutations within a PY-NLS. Nuclear import of FUS is dependent on Transportin, and interference with this transport pathway leads to cytoplasmic redistribution and recruitment of FUS into stress granules. Moreover, proteins known to be stress granule markers co-deposit with inclusions in fALS and FTLD-FUS patients, implicating stress granule formation in the pathogenesis of these diseases. We propose that two pathological hits, namely nuclear import defects and cellular stress, are involved in the pathogenesis of FUS-opathies."

Since only the mutants, but not the endogenous wild-type FUS, are associated with stress granules under most of the stress conditions reported to date, the relationship between FUS and stress granules represents a mutant-specific phenotype and thus may be of significance in mutant-induced pathogenesis. While the association of mutant-FUS with stress granules is well established, the effect of the mutant protein on stress granules has not been examined. Here we investigated the effect of mutant-FUS on stress granule formation and dynamics under conditions of oxidative stress.\nRESULTS: We found that expression of mutant-FUS delays the assembly of stress granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response."

SGs have been linked to several pathologies including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In ALS and FTD, the majority of cases have no known etiology and exposure to external stress is frequently proposed as a contributor to either disease initiation or the rate of disease progression. Of note, both ALS and FTD are characterized by pathological inclusions, where some well-known SG markers localize with the ALS related proteins TDP-43 and FUS. We propose that TDP-43 and FUS serve as an interface between genetic susceptibility and environmental stress exposure in disease pathogenesis.

Aggregation of CREST affects paraspeckle integrity, probably by trapping other paraspeckle proteins within aggregates. Like several other ALS-associated proteins, CREST is recruited to induced stress granules. Neither of the CREST mutations described in ALS alters its subcellular localization, stress granule recruitment or detergent solubility; however Q388stop mutation results in elevated steady-state levels and more frequent nuclear aggregation of the protein. Both wild-type protein and its mutants negatively affect neurite network complexity of unstimulated cultured neurons when overexpressed, with Q388stop mutation being the most deleterious. When overexpressed in the fly eye, wild-type CREST or its mutants lead to severe retinal degeneration without obvious differences between the variants.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that CREST and certain other ALS-linked proteins share several features implicated in ALS pathogenesis, namely the ability to aggregate, be recruited to stress granules and alter paraspeckle integrity.

In vitro and in vivo methylation assays showed that FUS/TLS could be methylated by PRMT1. The modulation of arginine methylation levels by a general methyltransferase inhibitor or conditional over-expression of PRMT1 altered slightly the nucleus-cytoplasmic ratio of FUS/TLS in cell fractionation assays. Although co-localized primarily in the nucleus in normal condition, FUS/TLS and PRMT1 were partially recruited to the cytoplasmic granules under oxidative stress, which were merged with stress granules (SGs) markers in SH-SY5Y cell.

We found that in response to oxidative stress and to environmental insults of different types TDP-43 is capable to assemble into stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes where protein synthesis is temporarily arrested. We demonstrated that a specific aminoacidic interval (216-315) in the C-terminal region and the RNA-recognition motif 1 domain are both implicated in TDP-43 participation in SGs as their deletion prevented the recruitment of TDP-43 into SGs. Our data show that TDP-43 is a specific component of SGs and not of processing bodies, although we proved that TDP-43 is not necessary for SG formation, and its gene silencing does not impair cell survival during stress. The analysis of spinal cord tissue from ALS patients showed that SG markers are not entrapped in TDP-43 pathological inclusions.

The autopsy findings in the proband, who died at 14 months of age from an unrelated illness, provided a rare opportunity to study the neuropathological basis of dominant congenital spinal muscular atrophy. There was a reduction in anterior horn cell number in the lumbar and, to a lesser degree, the cervical spinal cord, and atrophy of the ventral nerve roots at these levels, in the absence of additional peripheral nerve pathology or abnormalities elsewhere along the neuraxis. Despite the young age of the child at the time of autopsy, there was no pathological evidence of ongoing loss or degeneration of anterior horn cells suggesting that anterior horn cell loss in dominant congenital spinal muscular atrophy occurs in early life, and is largely complete by the end of infancy. These findings confirm that dominant congenital spinal muscular atrophy is a true form of spinal muscular atrophy caused by a loss of anterior horn cells localized to lumbar and cervical regions early in development."

We have reported previously that the exon-skipped product SMNDelta7 is partially defective for self-association and SMN self-oligomerization correlated with clinical severity. To evaluate systematically which of the five nucleotides that differ between SMN1 and SMN2 effect alternative splicing of exon 7, a series of SMN minigenes was engineered and transfected into cultured cells, and their transcripts were characterized. Of these nucleotide differences, the exon 7 C-to-T transition at codon 280, a translationally silent variance, was necessary and sufficient to dictate exon 7 alternative splicing. Thus, the failure of SMN2 to fully compensate for SMN1 and protect from SMA is due to a nucleotide exchange (C/T) that attenuates activity of an exonic enhancer. These findings demonstrate the molecular genetic basis for the nature and pathogenesis of SMA and illustrate a novel disease mechanism. Because individuals with SMA retain the SMN2 allele, therapy targeted at preventing exon 7 skipping could modify clinical outcome."

The SMN2 gene, a nearly identical copy of SMN1, has been detected as a promising target for SMA therapy. Both genes are ubiquitously expressed and encode identical proteins, but markedly differ in their splicing patterns: While SMN1 produces full-length (FL)-SMN transcripts only, the majority of SMN2 transcripts lacks exon 7. Transcriptional SMN2 activation or modulation of its splicing pattern to increase FL-SMN levels is believed to be clinically beneficial and therefore a crucial challenge in SMA research. Drugs such as valproic acid, phenylbutyrate, sodium butyrate, M344 and SAHA that mainly act as histone deacetylase inhibitors can mediate both: they stimulate the SMN2 gene transcription and/or restore the splicing pattern, thereby elevating the levels of FL-SMN2 protein. Preliminary phase II clinical trials and individual experimental curative approaches SMA patients show promising results. However, phase III double-blind placebo controlled clinical trials have to finally prove the efficacy of these drugs."

SMA are caused by mutations of the survival of motor neuron gene (SMN1) leading to a reduction of the SMN protein amount. The identification of SMN interacting proteins involved in the formation of the spliceosome and splicing changes in SMN-deficient tissues of mutant mice strongly support the view that SMN is involved in the splicing reaction. However, the molecular pathway linking SMN defect to the SMA phenotype remains unclear. From a better knowledge of the genetic basis of SMA and the defects resulting from the mutations of SMN1 in cellular or animal models, several therapeutics strategies have been selected aiming at targeting SMN2, a partially functional copy of SMN1 gene which remains present in patients, or to prevent neurons from death. Refined characterization of the degenerative process in SMA and the identification of the defective molecular pathway downstream from the SMN defect will provide further exciting insight into this disease in the near future. They should contribute to clarify the pathophysiology of SMA, the function of SMN and should help in designing potential targeted or non-targeted therapeutic molecules."

We tested the effects of ceftriaxone on mortality, neurological outcome, and infarct size in experimental stroke in rats and looked for underlying mechanisms.\nMETHODS: Male normotensive Wistar rats received ceftriaxone (200 mg/kg intraperitoneal) as a single injection 90 min after middle cerebral artery occlusion (90 min with reperfusion). Forty-eight hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion, infarct size (MRI) and neurological deficits were estimated. GLT1 expression was determined by real time RT-PCR, immunoblotting and promoter reporter assay, astrocyte GLT1 activity by measuring glutamate uptake. Bacterial load in various organs was measured by real time RT-PCR, neurotrophins and IL-6 by immunoblotting.\nRESULTS: Ceftriaxone dramatically reduced early (24-h) mortality from 34.5% (vehicle treatment, n = 29) to 0% (P < 0.01, n = 19). In a subgroup, followed up for 4 weeks, mortality persisted at 0%. Ceftriaxone strongly tended to reduce infarct size, it significantly improved neuronal survival within the penumbra, reduced neurological deficits (P < 0.001) and led to an upregulation of neurotrophins (P < 0.01) in the peri-infarct zone. Ceftriaxone did not increase GLT1 expression, but increased GLT1 activity (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Ceftriaxone causes a significant reduction in acute stroke mortality in a poststroke treatment regimen in animal studies. Improved neurological performance and survival may be due to neuroprotection by activation of GLT1 and a stimulation of neurotrophins resulting in an increased number of surviving neurons in the penumbra."

SOD1 toxicity is dose dependent; levels of mutant SOD1 protein in transgenic mice determine disease susceptibility, onset and rate of progression.

We tested pyrimethamine (previously reported to suppress SOD1 expression), several compounds currently in trials in human and murine ALS, and a set of 1040 FDA-approved compounds. In a PC12 cell-based assay, no compounds reduced SOD1 promoter activity without concomitant cytotoxicity. Additionally, pyrimethamine failed to repress levels of SOD1 protein in HeLa cells or homogenates of liver, spinal cord and brain of wild-type mice. Thirty-four compounds (including riluzole, ceftriaxone, minocyclin, PBA, lithium, acetylcysteine) in human and mouse ALS trials and an additional set of 1040 FDA-approved compounds also showed no effect on SOD1 promoter activity.

Inactivation of synaptic glutamate is handled by the glutamate transporter GLT1 (also known as EAAT2; refs 1, 2), the physiologically dominant astroglial protein. In spite of its critical importance in normal and abnormal synaptic activity, no practical pharmaceutical can positively modulate this protein. Animal studies show that the protein is important for normal excitatory synaptic transmission, while its dysfunction is implicated in acute and chronic neurological disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke, brain tumours and epilepsy. Using a blinded screen of 1,040 FDA-approved drugs and nutritionals, we discovered that many beta-lactam antibiotics are potent stimulators of GLT1 expression. Furthermore, this action appears to be mediated through increased transcription of the GLT1 gene. beta-Lactams and various semi-synthetic derivatives are potent antibiotics that act to inhibit bacterial synthetic pathways. When delivered to animals, the beta-lactam ceftriaxone increased both brain expression of GLT1 and its biochemical and functional activity. Glutamate transporters are important in preventing glutamate neurotoxicity. Ceftriaxone was neuroprotective in vitro when used in models of ischaemic injury and motor neuron degeneration, both based in part on glutamate toxicity. When used in an animal model of the fatal disease ALS, the drug delayed loss of neurons and muscle strength, and increased mouse survival. Thus these studies provide a class of potential neurotherapeutics that act to modulate the expression of glutamate neurotransmitter transporters via gene activation."

We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ceftriaxone for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in a combined phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trial.\nMETHODS: This three-stage randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was done at 59 clinical sites in the USA and Canada between Sept 4, 2006, and July 30, 2012. Eligible adult patients had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a vital capacity of more than 60% of that predicted for age and height, and symptom duration of less than 3 years. In stages 1 (pharmacokinetics) and 2 (safety), participants were randomly allocated (2:1) to ceftriaxone (2 g or 4 g per day) or placebo. In stage 3 (efficacy), participants assigned to ceftriaxone in stage 2 received 4 g ceftriaxone, participants assigned to placebo in stage 2 received placebo, and new participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to 4 g ceftriaxone or placebo. Participants, family members, and site staff were masked to treatment assignment. Randomisation was done by a computerised randomisation sequence with permuted blocks of 3. Participants received 2 g ceftriaxone or placebo twice daily through a central venous catheter administered at home by a trained caregiver. To minimise biliary side-effects, participants assigned to ceftriaxone also received 300 mg ursodeoxycholic acid twice daily and those assigned to placebo received matched placebo capsules.

Analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00349622.\nFINDINGS: Stage 3 included 66 participants from stages 1 and 2 and 448 new participants. In total, 340 participants were randomly allocated to ceftriaxone and 173 to placebo. During stages 1 and 2, mean ALSFRS-R declined more slowly in participants who received 4 g ceftriaxone than in those on placebo (difference 0\u00b751 units per month, 95% CI 0\u00b702 to 1\u00b700; p=0\u00b70416), but in stage 3 functional decline between the treatment groups did not differ (0\u00b709, -0\u00b706 to 0\u00b724; p=0\u00b72370). No significant differences in survival between the groups were recorded in stage 3 (HR 0\u00b790, 95% CI 0\u00b771 to 1\u00b715; p=0\u00b74146).

Here we review the evidence for the main pathogenic mechanisms and outline how they might interact to cause motor neuron death.

It is likely that effective therapy will involve combinations of agents acting on different mechanisms.

Dysfunction of EAAT2 is implicated in acute and chronic neurological disorders, including stroke/ischemia, temporal lobe epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, human immunodeficiency virus 1-associated dementia, and growth of malignant gliomas. Ceftriaxone, one of the beta-lactam antibiotics, is a stimulator of EAAT2 expression with neuroprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo models based in part on its ability to inhibit neuronal cell death by glutamate excitotoxicity. Based on this consideration and its lack of toxicity, ceftriaxone has potential to manipulate glutamate transmission and ameliorate neurotoxicity. We investigated the mechanism by which ceftriaxone enhances EAAT2 expression in primary human fetal astrocytes (PHFA). Ceftriaxone elevated EAAT2 transcription in PHFA through the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. The antibiotic promoted nuclear translocation of p65 and activation of NF-kappaB. The specific NF-kappaB binding site at the -272 position of the EAAT2 promoter was responsible for ceftriaxone-mediated EAAT2 induction. In addition, ceftriaxone increased glutamate uptake, a primary function of EAAT2, and EAAT2 small interference RNA completely inhibited ceftriaxone-induced glutamate uptake activity in PHFA. Taken together, our data indicate that ceftriaxone is a potent modulator of glutamate transport in PHFA through NF-kappaB-mediated EAAT2 promoter activation. These findings suggest a mechanism for ceftriaxone modulation of glutamate transport and for its potential effects on ameliorating specific neurodegenerative diseases through modulation of extracellular glutamate."

Lack of intracellular cystine leads to glutathione depletion and cell death because of oxidative stress. Ceftriaxone increased system x(c)(-) and glutathione levels independently of its effect on excitatory amino acid transporters by induction of the transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2), a known inducer of system x(c)(-), and the specific x(c)(-) subunit xCT. No significant effect was apparent in fibroblasts deficient in Nrf2 or xCT. Similar ceftriaxone-stimulated changes in Nrf2, system x(c)(-), and glutathione were observed in rat cortical and spinal astrocytes.

A number of studies have reported that drugs of abuse, including alcohol and cocaine, alter glutamate transport. Extracellular glutamate is regulated by a number of glutamate transporters in various brain regions. Of these transporters, glutamate transporter (GLT1) is a key player in the removal of most of the extracellular glutamate. Similar to neurodegenerative disease models, in which there is dysfunction of the glutamatergic excitatory system, the role of GLT1 has been tested in drug dependence models that show dysfunction of glutamate transmission. We and others have recently found that ceftriaxone, an FDA-approved drug known to elevate GLT1 expression, attenuates cue-induced cocaine relapse. Moreover, we recently found that alcohol-preferring rats treated with ceftriaxone showed a significant dosedependent reduction in alcohol consumption. We also demonstrated that ceftriaxone-induced upregulation of GLT1 expression was associated with increases in glutamate uptake in Huntington's disease mouse model. Importantly, ceftriaxone is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This review provides information about the potential therapeutic role of GLT1 for the treatment of alcohol abuse and dependence."

Striking improvements in the understanding of the genetic basis of this autosomal dominant genetic disease are coupled to the understanding of the mechanisms that link the loss of TSC1 (9q34) or TSC2 (16p13.3) genes with the regulation of the Rheb/m-TOR/p70S6K pathway.

One of the latest examples comes from the study of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). As a member of the phakomatoses, TSC is characterized by the appearance of benign tumors, most notably in the central nervous system, kidney, heart, lung, and skin. While classically described as \"hamartomas,\" the pathology of the lesions has features suggestive of abnormal cellular proliferation, size, differentiation, and migration. Occasionally, tumors progress to become malignant (i.e., renal cell carcinoma). The genetic basis of this disease has been attributed to mutations in one of two unlinked genes, TSC1 and TSC2. Cells undergo bi-allelic inactivation of either gene to give rise to tumors in a classic tumor suppressor \"two-hit\" paradigm. The functions of the TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, have remained ill defined until recently. Genetic, biochemical, and biologic analyses have highlighted their role as negative regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway.

These findings provide novel functional links between the TSC genes and other tumor suppressors responsible for Cowden's disease (PTEN), Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (LKB1), and familial polyposis (APC). Common sporadic cancers such as prostate, lung, colon, endometrium, and breast have ties to these genes, highlighting the potential role of the TSC proteins in human cancers. Rapamycin, a specific mTOR inhibitor, has potent antitumoral activities in preclinical models of TSC and is currently undergoing phase I/II clinical studies."

The objective of this study was to prospectively characterize the prevalence, clinical presentation, and genetic basis of lung disease in TSC. We performed genotyping and computerized tomographic (CT) scanning of the chest on 23 asymptomatic women with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Cystic pulmonary parenchymal changes consistent with LAM were found in nine patients (39%). These patients tended to be older than cyst-negative patients (31.9 +/- 7.6 yr versus 24.8 +/- 11.6 yr, p = 0.09).

Three of the cyst-positive patients had a prior history of pneumothorax. Pulmonary function studies revealed evidence of gas trapping but normal spirometric indices in the cyst-positive group. All nine cyst-positive patients had angiomyolipomas (AML), which were larger (p < 0.05) and more frequently required intervention (p = 0.08) than cyst-negative patients (8 of 14 with AMLs, p < 0.05). Ten patients (43%) had pulmonary parenchymal nodules. Pulmonary nodules were more common in women with cysts (78% versus 21%, p < 0.05), and 52% of all patients had either cystic or nodular changes. TSC2 mutations were identified in all cyst-positive patients who were tested (n = 8), whereas both TSC1 and TSC2 mutations were found in patients with nodular disease. Correlation of the mutational and radiographic data revealed one pair of sisters who were discordant for cystic disease, two mother- daughter pairs who were discordant for nodular disease, and no clear association between cyst development and a specific mutational type. This prospective analysis demonstrates that cystic and nodular pulmonary changes consistent with LAM and MMPH are common in women with TSC."

Here we chiefly focus on dS6k and S6K1, whose activities are regulated by an upstream kinase termed the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR, or dTOR in Drosophila). Our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the mTOR/S6K1-signalling pathway will be fundamental in determining the mechanisms which control cell growth in response to insulin signalling. Recent findings from this laboratory and others suggests that the tumour suppressor complex made of two proteins TSC1/hamartin and TSC2/tuberin, acts as a negative regulator of mTOR/S6K1 signalling. Mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 are genetically linked to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) syndrome, which can lead to severe pathological consequences, including mental retardation, epilepsy and autism, as well as cardiac, pulmonary and renal failure. Despite a large number of initial reports on the TSC1/TSC2 complex, and the finding that its activity is regulated by protein kinase B (PKB), the direct target of the TSC1/TSC2 inhibitory complex was unknown until recently. Since TSC2 has a GTPase-activating domain, or GAP-like sequence, others and we searched for a small GTP binding protein, which may serve as the target of TSC1/TSC2 inhibitory complex. In our case we took advantage of a genome wide screen in Drosophila for effectors of cell growth and in parallel searched for a small GTPase whose activity is up-regulated in TSC2-deficient cells. The identified gene was a member of the Ras family of GTPases termed Ras homologue enriched in brain or Rheb. Here we review recent findings demonstrating that the TSC1/TSC2 inhibitory complex normally acts on Rheb to mediate mTOR/S6K1-signalling."

All these crystals diffract X-rays to better than 2.8 A resolution and at least one diffraction data set has been collected for each crystal form using an in-house R-AXIS IV++ diffractometer. Structural studies of hRheb in complexes with various substrates may provide insights into the recognition and specificity of substrate and the catalytic mechanism of mammalian Rhebs and shed light on the biological functions of Rhebs in the mTOR signalling pathway."

Recent studies suggest that the tuberous sclerosis complex Tsc1-Tsc2 may couple insulin signalling to Tor activity [corrected]. However, the regulatory mechanism involved remains unclear, and additional components are most probably involved. In a screen for novel regulators of growth, we identified Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in brain), a member of the Ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins. Increased levels of Rheb in Drosophila melanogaster promote cell growth and alter cell cycle kinetics in multiple tissues. In mitotic tissues, overexpression of Rheb accelerates passage through G1-S phase without affecting rates of cell division, whereas in endoreplicating tissues, Rheb increases DNA ploidy. Mutation of Rheb suspends larval growth and prevents progression from first to second instar. Genetic and biochemical tests indicate that Rheb functions in the insulin signalling pathway downstream of Tsc1-Tsc2 and upstream of TOR. Levels of rheb mRNA are rapidly induced in response to protein starvation, and overexpressed Rheb can drive cell growth in starved animals, suggesting a role for Rheb in the nutritional control of cell growth."

TSC is characterized by benign tumors arising in different organs and severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as epilepsy, intellectual disability, autism, anxiety and depressive behaviour. Rapamycin is a potent inhibitor of mTOR and its efficacy in treating epilepsy and neurological symptoms remains elusive. In a mouse model in which Tsc1 has been deleted in embryonic telencephalic neural stem cells, we analyzed anxiety- and depression-like behaviour by elevated-plus maze (EPM), open-field test (OFT), forced-swim test (FST) and tail-suspension test (TST), after chronic administration of rapamycin. In addition, spectral analysis of background EEG was performed. Rapamycin-treated mutant mice displayed a reduction in anxiety- and depression-like phenotype, as shown by the EPM/OFT and FST, respectively. These results were inline with EEG power spectra outcomes. The same effects of rapamycin were observed in wild-type mice. Notably, in heterozygous animals we did not observe any EEG and/or behavioural variation after rapamycin treatment. Together these results suggest that both TSC1 deletion and chronic rapamycin treatment might have a role in modulating behaviour and brain activity, and point out to the potential usefulness of background EEG analysis in tracking brain dysfunction in parallel with behavioural testing."

We show that Tsc1 and Tsc2 can physically associate with TOR and function upstream of TOR genetically. In Drosophila melanogaster and mammalian cells, loss of Tsc1 and Tsc2 results in a TOR-dependent increase of S6K activity. Furthermore, although S6K is normally inactivated in animal cells in response to amino acid starvation, loss of Tsc1-Tsc2 renders cells resistant to amino acid starvation. We propose that the Tsc1-Tsc2 complex antagonizes the TOR-mediated response to amino acid availability. Our studies identify Tsc1 and Tsc2 as regulators of the amino acid-TOR pathway and provide a new paradigm for how proteins involved in nutrient sensing function as tumour suppressors."

Both proteins form a complex inhibiting mTOR signalling pathway and thus regulate cell size and proliferation. In this study, tuberin and hamartin expression was evaluated under a confocal microscope in six cases of Taylor's balloon cell type FCD. Three patients met the clinical criteria for TSC. In three other patients, TSC was excluded based on a panel of clinical and radiological examinations. Additionally, two cases of FCD type I and 3 samples of normal brain tissue were used as a reference group. We found loss of tuberin and hamartin expression in FCD type IIB lesions from patients with TSC. In sporadic FCD type IIB cases, only a few tuberin and hamartin positive cells were detected in the white-grey matter junction and in deeper parts of the white matter. Cortical balloon cells showed loss of both tuberin and hamartin. In contrast, the expression of tuberin and hamartin in FCD type I samples was strong, similarly to normal brain tissue. In conclusion, loss of TSC1 and TSC2 products expression in balloon cells of both cortical dysplasia type IIB in TSC-related and sporadic patients suggests that FCD type IIB may represent the focal form of TSC."

The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of cardiovascular manifestation in this cohort of patients.\nRESULTS: Aortic dilation was present in 172 patients (75.8%), mitral valve prolapse in 179 (78.9%).

Currently it is considered that the prognosis and morphologic characteristics in infantile Marfan syndrome may be quite different from those reported in older patients. The objective of this study was to analyze the cardiovascular manifestations and evolution of the patients with Marfan syndrome followed at our pediatric cardiac unit.\nMETHODS: The authors reviewed the clinical files of all the patients that fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for MS according to De Paepe et al. (1996). We analyzed the following parameters: gender, age at referral, race, family history, clinical examination, diagnostic exams, therapy and evolution. The patients were divided into two groups according to the age at diagnosis: infants (group 1) and older patients (group 2).\nRESULTS: Group 1 included 3 infants, two boys and one girl, sporadic cases, presenting congestive heart failure. The major cardiac diagnoses were aortic dilatation (1/3) and mitral valve prolapse with severe mitral regurgitation (2/3). Congenital heart disease was associated in two cases (patent ductus arteriosus and atrial septal defect). Two needed cardiac surgery at an early age and one was recently proposed for surgery. There were no deaths. Group 2 included 20 patients, 14 boys and 6 girls, first seen at a mean age of 8 years. Ten had a positive family history and none presented cardiac symptoms. The major cardiac manifestations were mitral valve prolapse (18/20) and aortic dilatation (17/20). There was no significant progression of the cardiac lesions, except for one case, during the 12 years of follow-up.\nCONCLUSION: Infantile MS presented high morbidity; mitral regurgitation was severe in two cases. All patients presented heart failure, two needing early operations. In classic MS evolution was favorable, and the commonest cardiac lesions were mitral valve prolapse and aortic dilatation. We emphasize the need for beta-blockers to prevent progression of aortic dilatation. The decision for surgery rests upon the severity of valve regurgitation and the rate of progression of aortic dilatation. It is important to inform patients and family about physical exercise, prevention of endocarditis, risks associated with pregnancy and genetic counseling."

                    "article": "CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: FBN1-related Marfan syndrome (Marfan syndrome), a systemic disorder of connective tissue with a high degree of clinical variability, comprises a broad phenotypic continuum ranging from mild (features of Marfan syndrome in one or a few systems) to severe and rapidly progressive neonatal multiorgan disease. Cardinal manifestations involve the ocular, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. Ocular findings include myopia (&gt;50% of affected individuals); ectopia lentis (seen in approximately 60% of affected individuals); and an increased risk for retinal detachment, glaucoma, and early cataracts. Skeletal system manifestations include bone overgrowth and joint laxity; disproportionately long extremities for the size of the trunk (dolichostenomelia); overgrowth of the ribs that can push the sternum in (pectus excavatum) or out (pectus carinatum); and scoliosis that ranges from mild to severe and progressive. The major morbidity and early mortality in Marfan syndrome relate to the cardiovascular system and include dilatation of the aorta at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva (predisposing to aortic tear and rupture), mitral valve prolapse with or without regurgitation, tricuspid valve prolapse, and enlargement of the proximal pulmonary artery. Severe and prolonged regurgitation of the mitral and/or aortic valve can predispose to left ventricular dysfunction and occasionally heart failure. With proper management, the life expectancy of someone with Marfan syndrome approximates that of the general population.\nDIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of Marfan syndrome is established in a proband (by definition a person without a known family history of Marfan syndrome) who has an FBN1 pathogenic variant known to be associated with Marfan syndrome and EITHER of the following: Aortic root enlargement (z score \u22652.0). Ectopia lentis.\nMANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Comprehensive management by a multidisciplinary team including a clinical geneticist, cardiologist, ophthalmologist, orthopedist, and cardiothoracic surgeon is strongly recommended. Treatment typically includes spectacle correction for refractive errors and, sometimes, surgical removal of a dislocated lens with artificial lens implantation (preferably after growth is complete). Glaucoma, cataracts, and retinal detachment are treated in the standard fashion per an ophthalmologist. Scoliosis may require bracing or surgical stabilization; repair of pectus deformity is largely cosmetic. Functional deficits or pain associated with protusio acetabulae may respond to physical therapy, analgesics, or anti-inflammatory medications. Orthotics and arch supports can lessen leg fatigue, joint pain, and muscle cramps associated with pes planus. Dental crowding may be addressed through orthodontia and a palatal expander may be considered in some cases. Surgical repair of the aorta is indicated either when the maximal measurement of the aortic root approaches 5.0 cm in adults or older children, when the rate of increase of the aortic root diameter approaches 0.5-1.0 cm per year, or if there is progressive and severe aortic regurgitation. For younger children, aortic root surgery should be considered once: (1) the rate of increase of the aortic root diameter approaches 0.5-1.0 cm per year, or (2) there is progressive and severe aortic regurgitation. Severe and progressive mitral valve regurgitation with attendant ventricular dysfunction requires immediate attention of a cardiologist or cardiothoracic surgeon and is the leading indication for cardiovascular surgery in children with Marfan syndrome. Afterload-reducing agents can improve cardiovascular function when congestive heart failure is present. Standard treatment for hernias and pneumothorax is recommended. There are no known effective therapies for symptomatic dural ectasia. Prevention of primary manifestations: Medications that reduce hemodynamic stress on the aortic wall, such as beta-blockers or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), are routinely prescribed. This therapy should be managed by a cardiologist or clinical geneticist familiar with its use. Therapy is generally initiated at the time of diagnosis with Marfan syndrome at any age or upon appreciation of progressive aortic root dilatation even in the absence of a definitive diagnosis. Surveillance: Measurement of length/height/weight at each visit. Ophthalmologic examination annually or as clinically indicated. Clinical assessment for chest wall deformities and scoliosis at each visit until skeletal maturity, although severe scoliosis may require ongoing surveillance in adulthood. At least annual dental evaluation, including orthodontia, as indicated. Echocardiography annually when aortic dimensions are small and the rate of aortic dilatation is slow; more frequent than annual examinations are indicated when the aortic root diameter exceeds approximately 4.5 cm in adults, rates of aortic dilatation exceed approximately 0.3 cm per year, or significant aortic regurgitation is present. Intermittent surveillance of the entire aorta with CT or MRA scans beginning in young adulthood or at least annually in anyone with a history of aortic root replacement or dissection. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Contact sports, competitive sports, and isometric exercise; activities that cause joint injury or pain; agents that stimulate the cardiovascular system, including decongestants and excessive caffeine; agents that cause vasoconstriction, including triptans; LASIK correction of refractive errors; breathing against resistance or positive pressure ventilation in those with a documented predisposition for pneumothorax; fluoroquinolone antibiotics, which may exacerbate the predisposition for aneurysm and dissection; classes of antihypertensive agents (e.g., calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors) where there is an absence of direct evidence for their efficacy or safety in individuals with Marfan syndrome. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is recommended that the genetic status of at-risk relatives of any age be clarified so that affected individuals can undergo routine surveillance for early detection of medically significant complications, particularly potentially life-threatening cardiac manifestations. Genetic status of at-risk relatives can be established EITHER: By molecular genetic testing if the FBN1 pathogenic variant in the family is known; OR. In those with a rigorously defined family history of Marfan syndrome, by the presence of ONE OR MORE of the following: Ectopia lentis. A systemic score \u22657. Aortic root dilatation (z score \u22652.0 for individuals age \u226520 years or z score \u22653.0 for those age &lt;20 years). Pregnancy management: An individual with Marfan syndrome should consider pregnancy only after appropriate counseling from a clinical geneticist or cardiologist familiar with this condition, a genetic counselor, and a high-risk obstetrician because of the risk of more rapid dilation of the aorta or aortic dissection during pregnancy, delivery, or in the immediate postpartum period. Cardiovascular imaging with echocardiography should be performed every two to three months during pregnancy to monitor aortic root size and growth. Monitoring should continue in the immediate postpartum period because of the increased risk for aortic dissection. Individuals with Marfan syndrome who anticipate pregnancy or become pregnant should continue use of beta-blockers; however, some other classes of medications such as ARBs should be discontinued because of the increased risk for fetal loss, oligohydramnios, and abnormal development, often related to second- and third-trimester exposure.\nGENETIC COUNSELING: Marfan syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 75% of individuals with Marfan syndrome have an affected parent; approximately 25% have a de novo FBN1 pathogenic variant. Each child of an individual with Marfan syndrome has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant and the disorder. Once the FBN1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

The progressive dilatation of the proximal aorta leading to dissection and rupture is the typical feature of the disease. Aortic aneurysm and aortic rupture are the lethal complications of the disorder. Increased life expectancy depends on the control and the prevention of the cardiovascular complications. The most frequent cardiovascular manifestation is the mitral valve involvement. The principal pathologic findings on the mitral valve are annular dilatation, fibromyxomatous changes of the leaflets and chordae, elongation and rupture of chordae and deposition of calcium. Prolapsus occurs in 80% of the cases. Elective surgery with optimal timing is associated with increased survival.

Each patient was evaluated according to the Ghent nosology. Echocardiography was used to measure the aortic root diameter and assess the presence of MVP and mitral regurgitation. Z-scores were calculated for the evaluation of the aortic root diameters. MRI was performed to determine the dural sac ratio (DSR).\nRESULTS: The prevalence of dural ectasia was 90.3\u200a%, of aortic root dilation 32.2\u200a%, of MVP 64.5\u200a% and of mitral regurgitation 51.6\u200a%. DSR at L5 correlated with the intraindividual z-scores (slope, 3.62\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.5 [0.56; 6.68]; r\u200a=\u200a0.17; p\u200a=\u200a0.02; F\u200a=\u200a5.84). Z-scores \u2265\u200a2 were accompanied by dural ectasia in 100\u200a%, MVP in 95\u200a% and mitral regurgitation in 100\u200a% of cases. MVP was accompanied by mitral regurgitation in 70\u200a% of cases.\nCONCLUSION: As the examined cardiac manifestations show a coincidence with dural ectasia in 95\u200a-\u200a100\u200a% of cases, MRI for diagnostic dural sac imaging should be reserved for MFS suspicions with the absence of those manifestations in order to establish the diagnosis according to the Ghent criteria. Thus, the present study supports the recent downgrading of dural ectasia to a contributor to the systemic score."

                    "article": "Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a systemic disorder of connective tissue with autosomal dominant inheritance. The diagnosis of MFS is based on the identification of a combination of clinical manifestations in the ocular, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular organ systems defined in the Ghent Nosology (De Paepe et al, 1996). Confirmation of the diagnosis in an individual requires the presence of major clinical manifestations in at least two organ systems associated with involvement of a third organ system. In relatives of an affected proband, major involvement of one organ system and involvement of a second organ system confirms the diagnosis. Major clinical criteria are very specific for MFS and include a combination of (4 out of 8) skeletal manifestations, ectopia lentis, dural ectasia and dilatation or dissection of the ascending aorta. The prevalence of- and the guidelines for the assessment of each of these major criteria are well established. Minor clinical criteria are less typical, but their importance in the diagnostic process should not be underestimated. Unfortunately, figures on the prevalence as well as practical guidelines for the assessment of most minor criteria are lacking, especially for those involving the cardiovascular system. The major cardiovascular manifestation in MFS is a progressive dilatation of the ascending aorta, leading to aortic aneurysm formation and eventually to fatal aortic rupture or dissection. Aortic dissection in early adult life is the leading cause of death in MFS. Early diagnosis of individuals at risk of the disease is extremely important as timely treatment of cardiovascular complications has greatly improved life expectancy in MFS. Despite progress in medical and surgical treatment of aortic aneurysms, MFS continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This may be related to inadequate diagnosis or treatment, but also to the occurrence of cardiovascular problems in ageing MFS patients that were unrecognised until now, such as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.This thesis is focused on the study of cardiovascular manifestations of MFS which localize beyond the aortic root and on the presently unknown relationship between the severity of the cardiovascular phenotype and the genotype. In the first part, we have studied the prevalence and diagnostic value of the following cardiovascular manifestations of MFS: mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and calcification of the mitral valve annulus, dilatation of the main pulmonary artery (MPA) and dilatation or dissection of the descending aorta. We found a significantly higher prevalence of MVP in MFS patients compared to normal controls, indicating that this feature is useful in the diagnostic evaluation of the condition. In contrast, calcification of the mitral valve annulus appears to be very uncommon, difficult to quantify and therefore not useful in the diagnosis of MFS. We also studied the dimension of the MPA in a series of MFS patients and defined a cut-of value that can be used in the diagnostic evaluation of adult MFS patients. In addition, we showed that diameters of the aorta measured at different levels beyond the aortic root are increased in MFS patients compared to controls. Unfortunately, there was too much overlap with the values obtained in the normal control population to provide cut-off values for the descending aorta. Based on these findings, we developed practical guidelines for the cardiovascular evaluation of patients referred for MFS. In the second part, we studied LV function in MFS patients free of valvular heart disease using a combination of echocardiography (both conventional echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We could demonstrate that MFS patients present a combination of systolic and diastolic dysfunction that is not related to valvular heart disease. This may be attributed to a primary contractile dysfunction of the myocardium and is likely related to the underlying alterations in the elastic features of the myocardium, resulting from the microfibrillar defect. This observation is important in the development of new therapeutic strategies for MFS. Affected individuals may benefit from a treatment with agents that support myocardial function such as angiotensin converting enzyme--inhibitors or angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers. Furthermore, since MFS patients survive longer thanks to improved medical and surgical treatments, LV dysfunction may become an important issue in the follow-up of these patients. In the third part, we have studied aspects of local and global wave reflection in the aorta of MFS patients. Early return of reflected waves boosts systolic pressure and presents an extra load for the heart and the central vessels. As such, these wave reflections are regarded as one of the important determinants of central blood pressure and can contribute to the development of aortic dilatation in MFS. However, we were unable to demonstrate clear differences in both local and global parameters of wave reflection between MFS patients and normal controls. This could be explained by the fact that increased length of the aorta on the one hand and increased aortic stiffness on the other hand counterbalance each other in MFS patients without yielding any net effect on wave reflection. In the last part of this thesis, we investigated the correlation between the severity of the cardiovascular phenotype in MFS and the type of FBN1 mutation. First, we investigated the correlation between parameters of aortic stiffness (distensibility and pulse wave velocity measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and the type of FBN1 mutation (missense or in-frame deletions/insertions versus nonsense or out-of-frame deletions/insertions). We could not demonstrate any significant differences between these different mutation types, indicating that the FBN1 genotype is not the sole determinant of aortic stiffness. Second, we provided a detailed description of clinical findings in three unrelated MFS families in which an FBN1 mutation was identified and which demonstrate striking intrafamilial phenotypic variability as another illustration of the absence of genotype/phenotype correlations in MFS. This study also illustrated several important issues in MFS. First, repeated clinical examination of suspected patients can be necessary in order to establish a correct and final diagnosis. Second, extensive family history taking and clinical examination of first degree relatives can be highly contributory to the diagnosis. Third, patients with an 'atypical' MFS phenotype may show substantial clinical overlap with other connective tissue disorders such as Weill-Marchesani syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and represent a diagnostic challenge. We demonstrated that additional mutational analysis of the FBN1 gene can be a valuable aid to the diagnosis and help to outline medical management options in these challenging cases. In conclusion, we have refined diagnostic guidelines for the assessment of minor cardiovascular manifestations in MFS, shown that LV dysfunction is part of the cardiovascular spectrum and should be followed in the management of MFS patients, and demonstrated that aortic wave reflection is not elevated in MFS. In this work, we also investigated genotype/phenotype correlations, illustrated the marked (intrafamilial) variability in phenotypic expression of the condition, and the value of molecular testing in the diagnosis of MFS. Overall, this thesis nicely illustrates that close interaction and collaboration between cardiology and genetics is an added value to the study of disease pathogenesis of MFS and aortic aneurysms in general."

Echocardiograms assessed: the presence of mitral valve prolapse, aortic root diameter, mitral and aortic valves regurgitation, and aortic enlargement during beta-blocker therapy. Eleven patients had two measurements of the aortic root taken one year apart.\nRESULTS: The children were asymptomatic throughout the study. Mitral prolapse was found in 11 (52%) children. Annuloaortic ectasia occurred in 16 (76%) patients and found to be mild in 42.8%, moderate in 9.5%, and severe in 23.8%. One of these patients underwent aortic valve replacement and repair of the ascending aorta by the Bentall-De Bono technique, with good results. Heart rate decreased by 13.6% (from 85 to 73 bpm; p < 0.009) with the use of beta-blockers; however, aortic root diameter increased by 1.4 mm/year (p < 0.02). One child could not be given beta-blockers due to bronchial asthma, and no significant side effects were observed in the remaining children, including one who also had bronchial asthma.\nCONCLUSION: The children remained asymptomatic throughout the study, the use of beta-blockers led to a significant decrease in heart rate, and no significant adverse effects were observed. Contrary to the literature, incidence of annuloaortic ectasia was high among the study population, greater than that of mitral valve prolapse, even during beta-blocker therapy."

Echocardiographic evaluation of these patients showed marked heart valve involvement. In Marfan syndrome, it is known that the aortic valve is affected following mitral valve involvement.

The entire cardiovascular system is affected in patients with Marfan syndrome. Aortic root dilatation, aortic valve regurgitation or - the most feared and life-threatening symptom - aortic root dissection are the most common manifestations. Therapeutic strategies, such as prophylactic aortic root surgery and pharmacological therapy, focus on the prevention of aortic dissection. Currently, the standard medicinal treatments targeting aortic dilatation and dissection consist of agents generally used to lower blood pressure and/or the inotropic state of the heart. By these means, the cyclic repetitive forces exerted on the aortic wall are diminished and thus the onset of aortic dilatation is potentially prevented. Although these pharmacological agents may offer some benefit in reduction of aortic aneurysm expansion rate, they do not target the underlying cause of the progressive aortic degradation.\nAREAS COVERED: This review discusses the effectiveness of frequently prescribed medications used to prevent and delay aortic complications in Marfan syndrome. New insights on the biochemical pathways leading to aortic disease are also discussed to highlight new targets for pharmacological therapy.\nEXPERT OPINION: Recent insights in the transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway and inflammatory mechanisms in a well-established mouse model of Marfan syndrome, have led to studies exploring new pharmacological treatment strategies with doxycycline, statins and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Pharmacological therapy is focused more on prevention than on delay of aortic wall pathology in Marfan syndrome. Of the new pharmacological treatment strategies targeting aortic pathology in Marfan syndrome, angiotensin receptor type 1 blockers are promising candidates, with several clinical trials currently ongoing."

Investigation of murine models of this disease has led to improved understanding of the mechanisms that underlie many of the phenotypic features of MFS, including MV disease.

Only scant data exist describing MVP in patients with Marfan syndrome undergoing aortic root replacement.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 166 MFS patients with MVP who were enrolled in a prospective multicenter registry of patients who underwent aortic root aneurysm repair. Of these 166 patients, 9% had mitral regurgitation (MR) grade >2, and 10% had MR grade 2. The severity of MVP and MR was evaluated by echocardiography preoperatively and \u2264 3 years postoperatively. Forty-one patients (25%) underwent composite graft aortic valve replacement, and 125 patients (75%) underwent aortic valve-sparing procedures; both groups had similar prevalences of MR grade >2 (P=0.7). Thirty-three patients (20%) underwent concomitant mitral valve (MV) intervention (repair, n=29; replacement, n=4), including all 15 patients with MR grade >2. Only 1 patient required MV reintervention during follow-up (mean clinical follow-up, 31 \u00b1 10 months).

One early death and 2 late deaths occurred.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of patients with Marfan syndrome who undergo elective aortic root replacement have MVP, only 20% have concomitant MV procedures. These concomitant procedures do not seem to increase operative risk. In patients with MR grade \u2264 2 who do not undergo a concomitant MV procedure, the short-term incidence of progressive MR is low; however, more follow-up is needed to determine whether patients with MVP and MR grade \u2264 2 would benefit from prophylactic MV intervention."

Our previous studies revealed that olfactory axons display defective pathfinding and targeting in the setting of Mecp2 mutation. In the present work, we use Mecp2 mutant mouse models and the olfactory system to investigate dendritic development. Here, we demonstrate that mitral cell dendritic development proceeds normally in mutant mice, resulting in typical dendritic morphology at early postnatal ages. We also failed to detect abnormalities in dendritic inputs at symptomatic stages when glomeruli from mutant mice appear smaller in area than the wild type (WT) (6 weeks postnatally). Collectively, these findings suggest that the initial defects in glomeruli impairment seen with Mecp2 mutation do not result from abnormal dendritic development.

It is a leading cause of mental retardation and autistic behavior in girls and women; a hallmark of the disease is incessant hand movements in the form of wringing, twisting, or clapping. It was recently discovered that RTT is caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene. MECP2 assists in the transcriptional silencing process via DNA methylation; we hypothesize that disruption of this gene alters the normal developmental expression of various other genes, some of which must account for the peculiar neurologic phenotype of RTT. Molecular studies have identified MECP2 mutations in up to 80% of classic RTT patients; mutation type has some effect on the phenotypic manifestation of RTT, but the pattern of X inactivation seems to determine phenotypic severity. Favorable (skewed) X inactivation can so spare a patient from the effects of mutant MECP2 that they display only the mildest learning disability or no phenotype at all. The unmitigated impact of mutant MECP2 can be inferred from the few males who have been born into RTT kindreds with such severe neonatal encephalopathy that they did not survive their second year. MECP2 mutations thus manifest in a far broader array of phenotypes than classic RTT. This discovery should prove helpful in diagnosing cases of mild learning disability or severe neonatal encephalopathies of unknown cause and also should provide insight into the pathogenesis of RTT."

The N37OS mutation appeared in 69.77% of the mutated alleles in Jewish patients and in 22.86% of the mutated alleles in non-Jews. The 84GG mutation, which has not been found so far among non-Jewish patients, existed in 10.17% of the disease alleles among Jewish patients. The IVS + 1 mutation constituted 2.26% of the disease alleles among Jewish patients and 1.43% among the non-Jewish patients. RecTL, a complex allele containing four single-base-pair changes, occurred in 2.26% of the alleles in Jewish patients and was found in two (1.43%) of the patients of non-Jewish extraction. Another complex allele, designated \"RecNciI\" and containing three single-point mutations, appeared in 7.8% of alleles of non-Jewish patients and in only two (0.56%) of the Jewish families. The prevalence of the L444P mutation among non-Jewish Gaucher patients was 31.43%, while its prevalence among Jewish patients was only 4.24%. The prevalence of two other point mutations--D409H and R463C--was 5.00% and 3.57%, respectively, among non-Jewish patients and was not found among the Jewish Gaucher patient population. The prevalence of the R496H mutation, found so far only among Jewish patients, was 1.13%. The results presented demonstrate that seven mutations identify 90.40% of the mutations among Jewish patients and that these seven mutations allow diagnosis of only 73.52% of the non-Jewish patients. Identification of additional mutant alleles will enhance the accuracy of carrier detection."

Mutations in GBA may lead to Gaucher disease, an inborn metabolic disorder. Disease-causing mutations and neutral variation in the gene have been compared to neutral variation in the pseudogene. This comparison offers a unique opportunity to better understand the action of purifying selection, since the differences between mutational patterns can be attributed to different selective pressures. A similar frequency of CpG dinucleotides was observed in GBA and in psGBA, and CpG pairs were mutated with the same high frequency in both regions. However, nucleotides not in CpG pairs were more likely to contribute to disease-causing mutation than to accepted polymorphisms. This pattern, which resulted in a lower transition to transversion ratio in the gene, may be due to CpG avoidance on critical regions within exons."

The glucose analogue, N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ, Miglustat), is an inhibitor of the ceramide-specific glucosyltransferase (CSG) which catalyzes the first step of glycosphingolipids biosynthesis and is currently approved for the oral treatment of type 1 GD. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we constructed plasmids containing wild-type and several mutations in glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene. The plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells and stable transfected cell lines were obtained by geneticin (G418) selection. Cells were cultured during 6 days with medium with or without 10 microM NB-DNJ. The addition of NB-DNJ to COS-7 cell medium leads to 1.3-, 2.1-, 2.3-, 3.6-, and 9.9-fold increase in the activity of S364R, wild-type, N370S, V15M, and M123T GC, respectively. However, no significant changes were observed in the activity of the L444P, L336P, and S465del mutated proteins, but a small decrease in the rare P266L variant was observed. These results suggest that NB-DNJ, in addition to the inhibitory effect on CSG, also works as a \"chemical chaperone\", increasing the activity of acid beta-glucosidase of wild-type and several GC mutated proteins, including the most frequent N370S mutation. The specific location of the Miglustat binding site in GC is unknown. Potential binding sites in the enzyme have been searched for using computational molecular docking. The searching strategy identified three potential GC binding sites for Miglustat, one being the substrate-binding site of the enzyme, which was the best-ranked site by AutoDock program. Therefore, it is possible that Miglustat exerts its chaperoning activity on acid beta-glucosidase by acting as an inhibitor bound at the active site. This increase on the activity of the acid beta-glucosidase would imply that Miglustat is not only a substrate reducer but also an inhibitor of the GC degradation, with very promising clinical implications for the treatment of GD patients."

We describe homozygosity for the D409H mutation within the glucocerebrosidase gene associated with a unique form of type 3 Gaucher disease. Twelve patients, originating from three Arab sibships, were found to be homozygous for the D409H mutation. They all presented with oculomotor apraxia and a progressive cardiac valve defect with minimal organomegaly. When expressed in human cells in tissue culture, using the T7/EMC/vaccinia virus hybrid expression system, we were able to demonstrate that the mRNA carrying the D409H mutation was less stable than the normal counterpart. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the mutated protein exhibited lower stability than the normal counterpart. Its activity toward the artificial substrate 4-methyl umbelliferyl glucopyranoside was similar to that of the mutated enzymes carrying the N370S or the L444P mutations. However, in loading experiments using lissamine-rhodamine conjugated glucosyl ceramide as a substrate, the recombinant mutated protein carrying the D409H mutation exhibited 28.63 +/- 6.05% of the activity exhibited by the normal enzyme. L444P and N370S mutations exhibited 51.90 +/- 7.16 and 115.75 +/- 12.64% of normal enzyme activity, respectively. Loading of cells homozygous for the D409H mutation demonstrated 10. 05% of the activity shown by normal cells. L444P and N370S homozygous cells demonstrated 25.3 and 98.5% of foreskin fibroblast glucocerebrosidase activity, respectively. We demonstrate that homozygosity for the D409H mutation is a unique case of a peculiar phenotype associated with a specific intracellular glucocerebrosidase activity."

The data indicate that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was elevated in Drosophila eye carrying mutated hGBAs by using of the ER stress markers dXBP1 and dBiP.

In this study, we sought to examine potential GBA transcriptional regulatory elements for variants that contribute to phenotypic diversity. Specifically, we generated the genomic sequence for the orthologous genomic region ( approximately 39.4kb) encompassing GBA in eight non-human mammals. Computational comparisons of the resulting sequences, using human sequence as the reference, allowed the identification of multi-species conserved sequences (MCSs). Further analyses predicted the presence of two putative clusters of transcriptional regulatory elements upstream and downstream of GBA, containing five and three transcription factor-binding sites (TFBSs), respectively. A firefly luciferase (Fluc) reporter construct containing sequence flanking the GBA gene was used to test the functional consequences of altering these conserved sequences. The predicted TFBSs were individually altered by targeted mutagenesis, resulting in enhanced Fluc expression for one site and decreased expression for seven others sites. Gel-shift assays confirmed the loss of nuclear-protein binding for several of the mutated constructs. These identified conserved non-coding sequences flanking GBA could play a role in the transcriptional regulation of the gene contributing to the complexity underlying the phenotypic diversity seen in GD."

This heterogeneity is attributed in part to the existence of a large number of mutations in the corresponding gene.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: To establish genotype-phenotype relationships, we analyzed the residual enzyme activities of six naturally occurring mutations found in Spanish population in the glucocerebrosidase gene [c.160G > A (V15M), c.485T>C (M123T), c.914C>T (P266L), c.1124T>C (L336P), c.1207A>C (S364R) and c.1510-1512delTCT (S465del)]. The mutated genes were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCR 3.1 and expressed by transient transfection in COS cells. The enzymatic activity of the expressed protein were measured and compared with the wild-type human glucocerebrosidase cDNA. Also, two previously alleles, c.1226A>G (N370S) and c.1448T>C (L444P), were used for comparative purposes.\nRESULTS: The residual activity of the expressed proteins using the synthetic substrate (4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 4MU-Glu) ranged from 5.5% (for the 3-bp deletion) to 42.7% (for S364R mutation) of the activity of the wild-type enzyme.\nCONCLUSION: The present analyses may help to better understand the molecular basis and the pathogenesis of Gaucher disease. However, results of expression of mutated enzymes are necessary but not sufficient to explain the ultimate clinical outcome of Gaucher disease."

This study was undertaken to identify mutant alleles in such incompletely characterized Gaucher disease, in an attempt to find further correlations between clinical phenotype and the presence of acid beta-glucosidase alleles. RNA was isolated from Gaucher cell lines and converted to cDNA, the cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned, and several clones for each allele were sequenced. Several new singly mutated and multiply mutated alleles were identified, and sequence-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was used to verify the presence of these mutations in the genome of these patients. All newly identified mutations occurred only rarely in the Gaucher disease population, making it difficult to determine whether inheritance of a particular combination of alleles always correlates with the clinical manifestations seen in the test patients. Three of the newly described alleles were single missense mutations in exon 8, one was a single missense mutation in exon 5, and the fifth was a complex allele, comprising a series of different point mutations scattered throughout exons 5 and 6.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Carriers are considered to be healthy subjects because there is no manifestation of the disease, but they show signs of macrophage disfunction. The aim of the study was to determine if GD patients and non affected carriers risk suffering other diseases when compared to healthy non-carrier relatives.\nDESIGN: Epidemiologic study of historic cohorts. The fact that they have one or two mutated alleles has been considered to be the risk factor leading to other conditions (Dementia, Parkinson disease, Ischemic stroke, Ischemic heart disease, Non rheumatic valvular disease, Cancer hematological and non-hematological, Pulmonary fibrosis, Tuberculosis, Gallstones and Schizophrenia). All people, patients, carriers and healthy controls shared the same genetical background and environmental influence. - Patients and relatives enrolled on the Spanish Gaucher Disease Registry were evaluated.\nSTATISTICS: For the Relative-Risk calculation the Mantel-Haenszel test was applied. Yates' correction was used when size sample was too small. A value of p <0.05 was accepted for statistical significance.\nRESULTS: 370 people, from 79 different families, were surveyed. We received evaluable information from 45 families (56%), totalling 258 people (69%): 59 healthy subjects (Mean age 32. 20, RANGE: 10-85; M 57.63%/F 42.37%), 132 carriers (Mean age 35.91, RANGE: 1-79; M 56.82%/F 43.18%) and 67 patients (Mean age 32.16, Range: 1-76; M 44.78%/F 55.22%. - Relative Risk of suffering any disease with regard to Gaucher's status: Patient vs Healthy 9.69 (95% Confidence interval [CI] 2.00-63.99; p 0.0006). Patient vs Carrier 3.74 (CI 1.53-9.27; p 0.001); Carrier vs Healthy 2.59 (CI 0. 52-12.50; p 0.21). Relative Risk of suffering any disease with regard to sex was 3.96 for female patients (CI 1.01-16.75; p 0.02) and 1.34 for female carriers (CI 0.27-6.75; p = 0.68).\nCONCLUSION: As a group, Gaucher's patients seem to have a greater risk of suffering other common unrelated diseases than carriers or healthy relatives. This excess of risk is particularly higher among female patients and can not be explained in terms of differences in age. Carrier status doesn't seem to highten the risk of suffering other diseases."

The glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA), located in a gene-rich region on chromosome 1q 21, is mutated in Gaucher disease. The presence of contiguous, highly homologous pseudogenes for both GBA and metaxin 1 at this locus increases the likelihood of DNA rearrangement. We describe a facile method to identify and analyze recombinant alleles in patients with Gaucher disease. Genomic DNA from 20 patients with recombinant GBA alleles and five controls was evaluated to identify DNA rearrangements or copy number variation using six probes specific for either the GBA gene or pseudogene. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on genomic DNA, and Southern blot analyses using HincII together with sequencing confirmed the real-time results. Both GBA fusions and duplications could be detected. Different sites of crossover were identified, and alleles resulting from gene conversion could be distinguished from reciprocal recombinant alleles. Quantitative real-time PCR is a sensitive and rapid method to detect fusions and duplications in patients with recombinant GBA alleles. This technique is more sensitive, faster, and cheaper than Southern blot analysis, and can be used in diagnostic laboratories, and to detect other recombinant alleles within the genome."

Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of PCR products obtained from DNA of peripheral blood leukocytes was performed for mutation analysis. Gene deletion was detected by comparison of radioactively labelled PCR fragments of both the functional beta-glucocerebrosidase gene and the pseudogene. Among the unrelated patients, 50 alleles were investigated and the mutations identified in 35 alleles (70%), whereas 15 alleles (30%) remained unidentified. The most prevalent mutation in our group of patients was the 1226G (370Asn-->Ser) mutation, accounting for 18 alleles (36%), followed by the 1448C (444Lcu-->Pro) mutation, that was found in 12 alleles (24%). A complete gene deletion was present in two alleles (4%). The IVS1+2 (splicing mutation), the 1504T (463Arg-->Cys) as well as the 1342C (409Asp-->His) mutations were each present in one allele (2%). None of the alleles carried the 84GG (frame-shift), 1604A (496Arg-->His) or the 1297T (394Val-->Leu) mutation.

The complexity of identification and characterization of mutations in the gene of glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) is caused by a great amount of mutated alleles, the existence of a highly homologous pseudogene and its location in a very rich zone in genes, which promotes the presence of complex alleles. Although genotype-phenotype correlations in EG are not completely established, there are a series of generalities, as the mutation c.1226A>G (N370S) is often associated with a certain degree of neuroprotection and the homozygosity for the c.1448T>C (L444P) mutation presents with neurological symptoms."

The pathogenic pathways resulting from lipid laden macrophages (Gaucher cells) in visceral organs and their abnormal functions are obscure.\nRESULTS: To elucidate this pathogenic pathway, developmental global gene expression analyses were conducted in distinct Gba1 point-mutated mice (V394L/V394L and D409 V/null). About 0.9 to 3% of genes had altered expression patterns (\u2265 \u00b1 1.8 fold change), representing several categories, but particularly macrophage activation and immune response genes. Time course analyses (12 to 28 wk) of INF\u03b3-regulated pro-inflammatory (13) and IL-4-regulated anti-inflammatory (11) cytokine/mediator networks showed tissue differential profiles in the lung and liver of the Gba1 mutant mice, implying that the lipid-storage macrophages were not functionally inert. The time course alterations of the INF\u03b3 and IL-4 pathways were similar, but varied in degree in these tissues and with the Gba1 mutation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Biochemical and pathological analyses demonstrated direct relationships between the degree of tissue glucosylceramides and the gene expression profile alterations. These analyses implicate IFN\u03b3-regulated pro-inflammatory and IL-4-regulated anti-inflammatory networks in differential disease progression with implications for understanding the Gaucher disease course and pathophysiology."

The T6433C (L444P) substitution is prevalent in type GD II. It may occur alone as a single base-pair mutation but often is found as part of a complex allele containing additional GBA nucleotide substitutions, G6468C (A456P) and G6482C (V460V), without (recNciI) or with (recTL) G5957C (D409H). This complex allele is presumed to have formed by recombination (crossover, fusion) of the structural gene with the pseudogene, which contains the mutated sequences. Two complex alleles have never been demonstrated to coexist in any individual. We devised a selective PCR method for the specific amplification of the normal and/or fusion gene. Using this procedure we demonstrated the fusion gene in homozygous form for the first time, in a Macedonian/Ashkenazi Jewish GD type II fetus. Both parents were carriers of the recombination. This was confirmed by direct sequence analysis. A previous conceptus in this family was stillborn at 36 weeks, with features of severe type II GD. Neonates showing a severe clinical phenotype, analogous to the early neonatal lethal disease occurring in mice homozygous for a null allele produced by targeted disruption of GBA, have been described elsewhere, but the specific mutations in these cases have not yet been characterized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Sequence analysis of a mutated cDNA derived from a type II Gaucher patient revealed a C-to-G transversion causing a substitution of an arginine for a proline at residue 415. This change creates a new cleavage site for the enzyme HhaI in the mutated cDNA. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization made it possible to show that this mutation exists in the genomic DNA of the patient. From a cDNA library originated from a type I Gaucher patient, a mutated allele was cloned that contains a T-to-C transition causing a substitution of proline for leucine at residue 444 and creating a new NciI site. This mutation is identical to that described by S. Tsuji and colleagues in genomic DNA from type I, type II, and type III patients. Since the new NciI site generates RFLP, it was used to test the existence of this mutated allele in several Gaucher patients by Southern blot analysis. This allele was found in type I (Jewish and non-Jewish), type II, and type III Gaucher patients. These findings led us to conclude that the patient suffering from type II disease (denoted GM1260) carried both mutations described above. Any one of the amino acid changes described reduces the glucocerebrosidase activity as tested by transfection of COS cells with expression vectors harboring the mutated cDNAs. The base changes in the two mutated cDNAs do not affect the electrophoretic mobility of the corresponding polypeptides on an SDS polyacrylamide gel."

Gaucher disease has marked phenotypic variation and molecular heterogeneity, and seven point mutations in the acid beta-glucosidase (beta-Glc) gene have been identified. By means of sequence-specific oligonucleotides (SSO), mutation 6433C has been detected homozygously in neuronopathic type 2 (acute) and type 3 (subacute) patients, as well as in children with severe visceral involvement who are apparently free of neuronopathic disease. To investigate the molecular basis for this puzzling finding, amplified beta-Glc cDNAs from 6433C homozygous type 2 and type 3 Gaucher disease patients were cloned and sequenced. The Swedish type 3 Gaucher disease patient was truly homozygous for alleles only containing the 6433C mutation. In comparison, the type 2 patient contained a singly mutated 6433C allele and a \"complex\" allele with multiple discrete point mutations (6433C, 6468C, and 6482C). Each of the mutations in the complex allele also was present in the beta-Glc pseudogene. SSO hybridization of 6433C homozygotes revealed that both type 2 patients contained additional mutations in one allele, whereas the 6433C alone was detected in both type 3 and in young severe type 1 Gaucher disease patients. These results suggest that the presence of the complex allele influences the severity of neuronopathic disease in 6433C homozygotes and reveal the central role played by the pseudogene in the formation of mutant alleles of the beta-Glc gene. Analysis of additional cDNA clones also identified two new alleles in a type 3 patient, emphasizing the molecular heterogeneity of neuronopathic Gaucher disease."

The results demonstrated that the D409H allele directed synthesis of cytoplasmic RNA with decreased stability compared with its normal counterpart or other mutated forms. The D409H and L444P mutated proteins had lower stability than that of their normal counterpart, while the recNcil-mutated protein was more stable. Only glucocerebrosidase forms harboring leucine at position 444 were recognized by the anti-glucocerebrosidase monoclonal antibodies used (8E4 and 2C7). Measurements of enzymatic activity of the recombinant proteins in cells loaded with a fluorescent glucosylceramide demonstrated that the N370S mutated enzyme had activity similar to that of the normal enzyme. The other mutated enzymes exhibited varying degrees of activities, generally corresponding to the phenotypes with which they are associated.

Future therapeutic approaches should be based on these mechanisms and given in combination so that different levels of the degenerative process are targeted. Protection against excitotoxicity could be achieved with a combination of pharmacologic agents having neuroprotective activity, such as antiglutamate agents (e.g., riluzole), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA antagonists, free-radical scavengers, calcium-channel blockers, and neurotrophic factors.

In clinical practice, diagnostic difficulties mostly arise with patients who present either with only upper motor neuron, or with only lower motor neuron signs. It may be difficult to distinguish ALS with clinically predominant lower motor neuron involvement from alternative diagnoses including spinal atrophies of adult onset, Kennedy's disease, inclusion body myositis and motor neuropathies with conduction blocks.

However, microglial-derived neurotoxic factors still remain largely unidentified in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. With excitotoxicity being a major mechanism proposed to cause motor neuron death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, our hypothesis was that excessive glutamate release by activated microglia through their system [Formula: see text] (a cystine/glutamate antiporter with the specific subunit xCT/Slc7a11) could contribute to neurodegeneration. Here we show that xCT expression is enriched in microglia compared to total mouse spinal cord and absent from motor neurons. Activated microglia induced xCT expression and during disease, xCT levels were increased in both spinal cord and isolated microglia from mutant SOD1 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mice. Expression of xCT was also detectable in spinal cord post-mortem tissues of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and correlated with increased inflammation. Genetic deletion of xCT in mice demonstrated that activated microglia released glutamate mainly through system [Formula: see text]. Interestingly, xCT deletion also led to decreased production of specific microglial pro-inflammatory/neurotoxic factors including nitric oxide, TNFa and IL6, whereas expression of anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective markers such as Ym1/Chil3 were increased, indicating that xCT regulates microglial functions. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mice, xCT deletion surprisingly led to earlier symptom onset but, importantly, this was followed by a significantly slowed progressive disease phase, which resulted in more surviving motor neurons. These results are consistent with a deleterious contribution of microglial-derived glutamate during symptomatic disease. Therefore, we show that system [Formula: see text] participates in microglial reactivity and modulates amyotrophic lateral sclerosis motor neuron degeneration, revealing system [Formula: see text] inactivation, as a potential approach to slow amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease progression after onset of clinical symptoms."

Herein we describe our applications of site-specific nucleases, especially transcription activator-like effector nucleases, to engineer specific alterations in the genomes of pigs and cows. We can introduce variable changes mediated by non-homologous end joining of DNA breaks to inactive genes. Alternatively, using homology-directed repair, we have introduced specific changes that support either precise alterations in a gene's encoded polypeptide, elimination of the gene or replacement by another unrelated DNA sequence. Depending on the gene and the mutation, we can achieve 10%-50% effective rates of precise mutations. Applications of the new precision genetics are extensive. Livestock now can be engineered with selected phenotypes that will augment their value and adaption to variable ecosystems. In addition, animals can be engineered to specifically mimic human diseases and disorders, which will accelerate the production of reliable drugs and devices.

Recently, this RNA-directed DNA endonuclease has been harnessed to target DNA sequences of interest. Here, we review the development of Cas9 as an important tool to not only edit the genomes of a number of different prokaryotic and eukaryotic species, but also as an efficient system for site-specific transcriptional repression or activation. Additionally, a specific Cas9 protein has been observed to target an RNA substrate, suggesting that Cas9 may have the ability to be programmed to target RNA as well. Cas proteins from other CRISPR/Cas subtypes may also be exploited in this regard. Thus, CRISPR/Cas systems represent an effective and versatile biotechnological tool, which will have significant impact on future advancements in genome engineering."

Knockout of AHR or ARNT prevented the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-dependent induction of all AHR target genes examined. Knockout of AHR or ARNT also significantly reduced basal cytochrome P4501B1 (CYP1B1) expression levels, which were restored with overexpression of either protein but not with a DNA binding-deficient AHR mutant. Basal and TCDD-, 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2)-, or TCDD + E2-dependent recruitment of AHR, ARNT, ER\u03b1, NCoA3, and RNA polymerase II to CYP1B1 as well as CYP1B1 mRNA levels were abolished in MCF7-AHR((ko)) and MDA-MB-231 AHR(ko) cells. However, reduced but significant E2-dependent recruitment of ER\u03b1, NCoA3, and RNA polymerase II to CYP1B1 and weak increases in CYP1B1 mRNA levels were observed in MCF7 ARNT((ko)) cells. Interestingly, E2-dependent increases in trefoil factor 1, but not growth regulation by estrogen in breast cancer 1 (GREB1) mRNA levels, were dependent on ARNT expression. Moreover, the TCDD-dependent increases in the proteolytic degradation of ER\u03b1 were prevented by the loss of AHR or ARNT. Our data show that AHR and ARNT play critical roles in the basal, TCDD, and E2-induced regulation of CYP1B1 but also reveal distinct roles for both proteins in ER\u03b1 transactivation."

The generation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and subsequent correction of the disease-causing mutations offer an ideal therapeutic solution to this problem. However, homologous recombination-based gene correction in human iPSCs remains largely inefficient. Here, we describe a robust process combining efficient generation of integration-free \u03b2-Thal iPSCs from the cells of patients and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-based universal correction of HBB mutations in situ. We generated integration-free and gene-corrected iPSC lines from two patients carrying different types of homozygous mutations and showed that these iPSCs are pluripotent and have normal karyotype. We showed that the correction process did not generate TALEN-induced off targeting mutations by sequencing. More importantly, the gene-corrected \u03b2-Thal iPS cell lines from each patient can be induced to differentiate into hematopoietic progenitor cells and then further to erythroblasts expressing normal \u03b2-globin.

RGENs are ribonucleoproteins that consist of guide RNA and Cas9, a protein component originated from Streptococcus pyogenes. These enzymes cleave chromosomal DNA, whose sequence is complementary, to guide RNA in a targeted manner, producing site-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the repair of which gives rise to targeted genome modifications. Despite broad interest in RGEN-mediated genome editing, these nucleases are limited by off-target mutations and unwanted chromosomal translocations associated with off-target DNA cleavages. Here, we show that off-target effects of RGENs can be reduced below the detection limits of deep sequencing by choosing unique target sequences in the genome and modifying both guide RNA and Cas9. We found that both the composition and structure of guide RNA can affect RGEN activities in cells to reduce off-target effects. RGENs efficiently discriminated on-target sites from off-target sites that differ by two bases. Furthermore, exome sequencing analysis showed that no off-target mutations were induced by two RGENs in four clonal populations of mutant cells. In addition, paired Cas9 nickases, composed of D10A Cas9 and guide RNA, which generate two single-strand breaks (SSBs) or nicks on different DNA strands, were highly specific in human cells, avoiding off-target mutations without sacrificing genome-editing efficiency. Interestingly, paired nickases induced chromosomal deletions in a targeted manner without causing unwanted translocations. Our results highlight the importance of choosing unique target sequences and optimizing guide RNA and Cas9 to avoid or reduce RGEN-induced off-target mutations."

Postreplicative MMR excises a relatively long tract of error-containing single-stranded DNA. MutL is a widely conserved nicking endonuclease that directs the excision reaction to the error-containing strand of the duplex by specifically nicking the daughter strand. Because MutL apparently exhibits nonspecific nicking endonuclease activity in vitro, the regulatory mechanism of MutL has been argued. Recent studies suggest ATP-dependent conformational and functional changes of MutL, indicating that the regulatory mechanism involves the ATP binding and hydrolysis cycle. In this study, we investigated the effect of ATP binding on the structure of MutL. First, a cross-linking experiment confirmed that the N-terminal ATPase domain physically interacts with the C-terminal endonuclease domain. Next, hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry clarified that the binding of ATP to the N-terminal domain induces local structural changes at the catalytic sites of MutL C-terminal domain. Finally, on the basis of the results of the hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiment, we successfully identified novel regions essential for the endonuclease activity of MutL. The results clearly show that ATP modulates the nicking endonuclease activity of MutL via structural rearrangements of the catalytic site. In addition, several Lynch syndrome-related mutations in human MutL homolog are located in the position corresponding to the newly identified catalytic region. Our data contribute toward understanding the relationship between mutations in MutL homolog and human disease."

These proteins recognize and bind DNA sequences based on a variable numbers of tandem repeats. Each repeat is comprised of a set of \u223c 34 conserved amino acids; within this conserved domain, there are usually two amino acids that distinguish one TALE from another. Interestingly, TALEs have revealed a simple cipher for the one-to-one recognition of proteins for DNA bases. Synthetic TALEs have been used to successfully target genes in a variety of species, including humans. Depending on the type of functional domain that is fused to the TALE of interest, these proteins can have diverse biological effects. For example, after binding DNA, TALEs fused to transcriptional activation domains can function as robust transcription factors (TALE-TFs), while fused to restriction endonucleases (TALENs) can cut DNA. Targeted genome editing, in theory, is capable of modifying any endogenous gene sequence of interest; this can be performed in cells or organisms, and may be applied to clinical gene-based therapies in the future. With current technologies, highly accurate, specific, and reliable gene editing cannot be achieved. Thus, recognition and binding mechanisms governing TALE biology are currently hot research areas. In this review, we summarize the major advances in TALE technology over the past several years with a focus on the interaction between TALEs and DNA, TALE design and construction, potential applications for this technology, and unique characteristics that make TALEs superior to zinc finger endonucleases."

In 81 patients with Marfan syndrome and seven healthy control subjects, aortic volumes and diameters at baseline were estimated by means of contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. At 3 years of follow-up, aortic expansion rate were calculated in a subgroup of 22 patients with Marfan syndrome. Total aortic volume was defined as volume measurement from the level of the aortic annulus to the aortic bifurcation. Intra- and interobserver agreement of aortic volume were calculated by using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Differences in variables were analyzed with the Student t test and logistic regression. Effect size was calculated.\nRESULTS: Intra- and interobserver agreement of aortic volume calculation was 0.996 and 0.980, respectively. Mean aortic volume was significantly greater in patients with Marfan syndrome than in control subjects (104 mL/m(2); 95% confidence interval [CI]: 95, 114 mL/m(2) vs 74 mL/m(2); 95% CI: 62, 87 mL/m(2); P < .001).

The entire cardiovascular system is affected in patients with Marfan syndrome. Aortic root dilatation, aortic valve regurgitation or - the most feared and life-threatening symptom - aortic root dissection are the most common manifestations. Therapeutic strategies, such as prophylactic aortic root surgery and pharmacological therapy, focus on the prevention of aortic dissection. Currently, the standard medicinal treatments targeting aortic dilatation and dissection consist of agents generally used to lower blood pressure and/or the inotropic state of the heart. By these means, the cyclic repetitive forces exerted on the aortic wall are diminished and thus the onset of aortic dilatation is potentially prevented. Although these pharmacological agents may offer some benefit in reduction of aortic aneurysm expansion rate, they do not target the underlying cause of the progressive aortic degradation.\nAREAS COVERED: This review discusses the effectiveness of frequently prescribed medications used to prevent and delay aortic complications in Marfan syndrome. New insights on the biochemical pathways leading to aortic disease are also discussed to highlight new targets for pharmacological therapy.\nEXPERT OPINION: Recent insights in the transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway and inflammatory mechanisms in a well-established mouse model of Marfan syndrome, have led to studies exploring new pharmacological treatment strategies with doxycycline, statins and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Pharmacological therapy is focused more on prevention than on delay of aortic wall pathology in Marfan syndrome. Of the new pharmacological treatment strategies targeting aortic pathology in Marfan syndrome, angiotensin receptor type 1 blockers are promising candidates, with several clinical trials currently ongoing."

Patients were evaluated by a cardiac surgeon, including echocardiographic, orthopedic, ophthalmologic and dental examinations. All patients received genetic counseling, and genetic sampling was performed if appropriate.\nRESULTS: The diagnosis of Marfan syndrome was confirmed in 146 patients (29.2%). Fifty-four patients (37%) underwent cardiac surgery on the aortic root, 4 patients had surgery on the mitral valve, 13 patients had combined surgery; 11 cases were emergent surgery for acute aortic dissection. Twenty-eight patients (52%) were operated on at our Division: 13 underwent valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David procedure), 1 underwent Yacoub remodeling procedure and 14 underwent Bentall procedure. Following the establishment of the Marfan Center, the David aortic valve-sparing operation was the most frequently performed procedure compared to the previous period of surgical activity (63 vs 22%, p<0.0001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Regular follow-up twice a year may allow to identify patients at risk for acute aortic syndromes.

The casuistics of this Marfan-Syndrome patient shows a particular rare associated organ-change--the kidney cysts--and illustrate the frequency of this hereditary disease."

A brief review follows on the diagnosis and treatment of ascending aortic dissection, and its specific nature in Marfan syndrome.\nCASE REPORT: A 33-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department of a district hospital with chest and back pain associated with vomiting, 20 hours after symptom onset. Initial physical examination revealed an aortic systolic murmur and musculoskeletal morphological abnormalities compatible with Marfan syndrome. Given suspected aortic dissection, a transthoracic echocardiogram was immediately performed, which showed an extensive intimal flap originating at the sinotubular junction. He was transferred to the cardiothoracic surgery department of a referral hospital where he was treated by a Bentall procedure.\nCONCLUSION: In this case, careful physical examination during initial assessment raised the suspicion that this patient was in a high-risk group for aortic dissection, thus avoiding unnecessary and lengthy exams. This diagnosis requires emergent surgical treatment, and so direct contact in real time between those making in the diagnosis and the surgeon is essential, as well as protocols governing immediate access to a surgical center."

Aortic disease, leading to progressive aneurysmal dilatation and dissection is the main cause of morbidity and mortality of Marfan patients. Current treatment (e.g. beta blockers and elective surgery) does postpone but cannot prevent aortic complications in these patients. Recent studies have found transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) to be involved in the aortic aneurysm formation. Losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker inhibits TGFbeta in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome leading to inhibition of aortic growth. The main objective of this trial is to assess whether losartan treatment leads to a clinically relevant decrease of aortic dilatation in adult patients with Marfan syndrome.\nMETHODS/DESIGN: COMPARE study (COzaar in Marfan Patients Reduces aortic Enlargement) is an open-label, randomized, controlled trial with blinded end-points. Treatment with losartan will be compared with no additional treatment after 3 years of follow-up. We will enroll 330 patients with MFS who will be randomly assigned to receive losartan or not. Patients taking beta-blockers will continue taking their standard treatment. The primary end-point is the largest change in aortic diameter at any aortic level measured by means of MRI. Secondary end-points are change in mortality, incidence of dissection, elective aortic surgery, aortic volume, aortic stiffness and ventricular function. We will also investigate gene and protein expression change in the skin under losartan therapy and create prediction models for losartan-treatment response and aortic dilatation.\nDISCUSSION: The COMPARE study will provide important evidence of effects of losartan treatment in adult Marfan patient population. We expect losartan to significantly reduce the occurrence and progression of aortic dilatation. This trial investigates a wide spectrum of clinical, genetic and biochemical effects of losartan aiming to provide further insight in the pathogenesis and treatment of Marfan syndrome.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Trial Register NTR1423."

When neural symptoms or findings do occur they may be related to stretching and traction mechanisms.

The major cardiovascular manifestations of this condition are aortic dilation, which may involve the proximal and distal aorta, aortic regurgitation, aortic dissection, mitral valve prolapse, and mitral regurgitation. Patients who have the Marfan syndrome should have serial echocardiograms to measure aortic root diameter carefully at the sinuses of Valsalva and subsequent levels (sinotubular junction, arch, descending and abdominal aorta). Additionally, color Doppler echocardiography assists in the diagnosis of aortic dissection and facilitates evaluation of the severity of aortic and mitral regurgitation that commonly complicate the Marfan syndrome. The risk of aortic dissection, which is the most serious manifestation of the Marfan syndrome, increases as the aorta enlarges. Therefore, elective composite graft surgery is recommended when the aortic root size reaches 60 mm, regardless of symptom status, or 55 mm in the presence of severe aortic regurgitation. Surgical replacement of the aortic root with a composite graft does not end the disease process. Color flow Doppler is useful in the diagnosis of dehiscence of the conduit sewing ring, coronary artery aneurysm, distal aortic dissections, and prosthetic valve dysfunction."

Endothelial dysfunction is thought to cause aortic dilation in subjects with a bicuspid aortic valve; however, the role of endothelial dysfunction and endothelial damaging factors has not been elucidated in Marfan syndrome. Flow-mediated dilation, a noninvasive measurement of endothelial function, was evaluated in 39 patients with Marfan syndrome. Aortic diameter was measured at the aortic annulus, aortic root at the sinus of Valsalva, sinotubular junction and ascending aorta by echocardiography, and adjusted for body surface area (BSA). The mean value of flow-mediated dilation was 6.5 \u00b1 2.4 %. Flow-mediated dilation had a negative correlation with the diameter of the ascending thoracic aorta (AscAd)/BSA (R = -0.39, p = 0.020) and multivariate analysis revealed that flow-mediated dilation was an independent factor predicting AscAd/BSA, whereas other segments of the aorta had no association. Furthermore, Brinkman index had a somewhat greater influence on flow-mediated dilation (R = -0.42, p = 0.008). Although subjects who smoked tended to have a larger AscAd compared with non-smokers (AscA/BSA: 17.3 \u00b1 1.8 versus 15.2 \u00b1 3.0 mm/m(2), p = 0.013), there was no significant change in flow-mediated dilation, suggesting that smoking might affect aortic dilation via an independent pathway. Common atherogenic risks, such as impairment of flow-mediated dilation and smoking status, affected aortic dilation in subjects with Marfan syndrome."

Many patients with presumed Marfan syndrome do not meet current diagnostic criteria. This study reviews the surgical aspects of aortic disease in 300 patients referred with the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.\nMETHODS: During a 16-year period, 300 patients with presumed Marfan syndrome underwent 398 operations on the aorta and branch arteries, including 125 aortic root operations, 59 aortic arch repairs, 31 descending thoracic aortic repairs, and 178 thoracoabdominal aortic repairs. Based on medical record review, patients were classified as confirmed Marfan syndrome if documented features satisfied current diagnostic criteria; patients not meeting these criteria were classified as suspected Marfan syndrome.\nRESULTS: There were 17 operative deaths (4.3%) after the 398 operations. Survival after the initial referral operation was 96.2% +/- 1.5% at 1 year, 82.7% +/- 2.4% at 5 years, and 74.6% +/- 3.1% at 10 years. Presentations, operative details, and outcomes were remarkably similar in the 137 patients (45.7%) with confirmed Marfan syndrome and the 163 patients (54.3%) with suspected Marfan syndrome. Freedom from repair failure, however, was significantly better in patients with confirmed Marfan syndrome (90.3% +/- 2.3% at 10 years) than in those with suspected Marfan syndrome (82.0% +/- 3.1% at 10 years; p = 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Operative treatment of the full spectrum of aortic disease in Marfan patients enables excellent long-term survival. Similarities in surgical aspects of aortic disease suggest that patients with features of Marfan syndrome who do not meet diagnostic criteria should be managed in the same manner as patients with confirmed Marfan syndrome."

Nevertheless, early diagnosis remains to be a challenge in the Emergency Department (ED), particularly in young individuals. In this study, we attempted to identify the characteristics of acute AoD among young individuals, particular in patients with Marfan syndrome.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an retrospective chart-review study conducted in a tertiary referring hospital. The hospital database was queried for the combination of AoD and patients under age of 40 years. The medical charts were reviewed to obtain demographic data, clinical data and laboratory characteristics by using a standardized data collection sheet. A comparison between Marfan syndrome and non-Marfan syndrome patients was performed.\nRESULTS: During the 10-years period, 18 of 344 patients with acute AoD were younger than 40 years-old. Patients with Marfan syndrome developed acute AoD at a younger age than patients without Marfan syndrome. The mean diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower in patients with Marfan syndrome upon presenting to the ED than those without. Patients with Marfan syndrome had trends toward higher risk of development of type A AoD, increased recurrence rate and higher mortality rate than those without. However, statistical significance was not present.\nCONCLUSION: ED physicians should have high alert to acute AoD in young patients presenting with severe unexplained chest and back pain, particularly in those patients with a history of heart diseases, hypertension, and Marfan syndrome or featuring Marfanoid habitus. Acute coronary syndrome, unexplained abdominal symptoms, and sudden cardiac arrest could be the initial manifestation of AoD in young patients. A low threshold to perform enhanced computed tomography may facilitate early diagnosis and timely treatment in this patient population."

These cysts usually asymptomatic and often found incidentally on magnetic resonance imaging, large cysts may cause neurological deficits and pain secondary to nerve root compression.\nDESIGN: Case reports.\nFINDINGS: Two patients with Marfan syndrome presented with urinary symptoms secondary to dural ectasia and sacral cysts. Patient 1 had a history of low back pain, erectile dysfunction, and occasional urinary incontinence and groin pain with recent symptom worsening. He underwent L5 partial laminectomy and S1-S2 laminectomy with sacral cyst decompression. Nine weeks later, he underwent drainage of a sacral pseudomeningocele. Pain and urinary symptoms resolved, and he remains neurologically normal 2 years after surgery. Patient 2 presented after a fall on his tailbone, complaining of low back pain and difficulty urinating. Physical therapy was implemented, but after 4 weeks, urinary retention had not improved. He then underwent resection of the sacral cyst and S1-S3 laminectomy. Pain and paresthesias resolved and bowel function returned to normal. Other than needing intermittent self-catheterization, all other neurologic findings were normal 30 months after surgery.\nCONCLUSION/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Surgical goals for sacral cysts include resection as well as closure of the dura, which can be challenging due to thinning from ectasia. Neurosurgical intervention in Marfan syndrome is associated with a high risk of dural tears and osseous complications, and should be performed only when symptoms are severe."

Patients had a median age of 7.4 months (2.9-37.8 months) at initiation of ERT. Ambulatory ECGs were obtained at determined intervals and analyzed.\nRESULTS: Significant ectopy was present in 2 of 12 patients. Patient 1 had 211 and 229 premature ventricular contractions (0.2% of heart beats) at baseline and at 11.5 weeks of ERT, respectively. Patient 2 had 10,445 premature ventricular contractions (6.7% of heart beats) at 11 weeks of therapy.\nCONCLUSION: Infantile Pompe disease may have preexisting ectopy; it may also develop during the course of ERT. Therefore, routinely monitoring patients using 24-hour ambulatory ECGs is useful. Periods of highest risk may be early in the course of ERT when there is a substantial decrease in left ventricular mass and an initial decrease in ejection fraction."

However, functional assay of the acid alpha-D-glucosidase of these patients showed its enzyme function to be defective. In the present study, first we identified a substitution site in four Chinese infantile patients with Pompe disease which is a cytidine to adenosine (C1935-->A) transversion at 5' end of exon 14 causing substitution of glutamic acid for aspartic acid at position 645 of the acid alpha-D-glucosidase.

Second, according to the screening data in 25 Chinese Pompe disease patients using digestion of RT-PCR amplified specific fragment with Aat II, the restriction fragment length analysis showed that patients presented the 861 bp band and the normal individuals presented the 728 bp and 133 bp polymorphic bands. We found that the frequency of mutant allele is 0.8 in infantile patients with Chinese Pompe disease and 0 in normal individuals. These results therefore indicate that Asp-645-->Glu mutation results in infantile form of Pompe disease as the major cause in Chinese patients in Taiwan."

Then, we determined in each separate case the number of affected atoms, the root-mean-square distance value and the solvent-accessible surface area value. The analysis revealed that the amino acid substitutions causing a processing or transport defect responsible for Pompe disease were widely spread over all of the five domains comprising the acid alpha-glucosidase. They were distributed from the core to the surface of the enzyme molecule, and the predicted structural changes varied from large to very small. Among the structural changes, we paid particular attention to G377R and G483R. These two substitutions are predicted to cause electrostatic changes in neighboring small regions on the molecular surface. The quality control system of the endoplasmic reticulum apparently detects these very small structural changes and degrades the mutant enzyme precursor (G377R), but also the cellular sorting system might be misled by these minor changes whereby the precursor is secreted instead of being transported to lysosomes (G483R)."

Here, we demonstrate significant pathological alterations at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) of the diaphragm and tibialis anterior muscle as prominent features of disease pathology in Gaa knockout mice. Postsynaptic defects including increased motor endplate area and fragmentation were readily observed in Gaa(-/-) but not wild-type mice. Presynaptic neuropathic changes were also evident, as demonstrated by significant reduction in the levels of neurofilament proteins, and alterations in axonal fiber diameter and myelin thickness within the sciatic and phrenic nerves. Our data suggest the loss of NMJ integrity is a primary contributor to the decline in respiratory and ambulatory function in Pompe and arises from both pre- and postsynaptic pathology. These observations highlight the importance of systemic phenotype correction, specifically restoration of GAA to skeletal muscle and the nervous system for treatment of Pompe disease."

In this study, we characterized the pharmacological chaperone 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) on 76 different mutant forms of GAA identified in Pompe disease. DNJ significantly increased enzyme activity and protein levels for 16 different GAA mutants in patient-derived fibroblasts and in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Additionally, DNJ increased the processing of these GAA mutants to their mature lysosomal forms, suggesting facilitated trafficking through the secretory pathway. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies showed increased colocalization of GAA with the lysosomal marker LAMP2 after incubation with DNJ, confirming increased lysosomal trafficking. Lastly, a GAA structural model was constructed based on the related eukaryotic glucosidase maltase-glucoamylase. The mutated residues identified in responsive forms of GAA are located throughout most of the structural domains, with half of these residues located in two short regions within the catalytic domain. Taken together, these data support further evaluation of DNJ as a potential treatment for Pompe disease in patients that express responsive forms of GAA."

Both clinical data and the results of preclinical studies in our knockout model of this disease show that rhGAA is much more effective in resolving the cardiomyopathy than the skeletal muscle myopathy. By contrast, another form of human GAA--transgenic enzyme constitutively produced in liver and secreted into the bloodstream of knockout mice (Gaa-/-)--completely prevented both cardiac and skeletal muscle glycogen accumulation. In the experiments reported here, the transgenic enzyme was much less efficient when delivered to skeletal muscle after significant amounts of glycogen had already accumulated.

After 24-h incubation with a single dose of recombinant enzyme, intracellular GAA and glycogen levels in deficient human fibroblasts were normalized, and this correction lasted for 7 d. The 110-kD precursor recombinant enzyme was processed to the 76-kD mature form within 24 h after uptake. Intracellular GAA levels in deficient quail fibroblasts and myoblasts were similarly corrected to their average normal levels within 24 h. Differences existed in the efficiency of endocytosis among subfractions of the enzyme, and among different cell types. Fractions with a larger proportion of precursor GAA were endocytosed more efficiently. Quail fibroblasts required a higher dose, 4200 nmol.h-1.mL-1 to normalize intracellular GAA levels than human fibroblasts, 1290 nmol.h-1.mL-1, whereas primary quail myoblasts required 2800 nmol.h-1.mL-1. In all three cell lines, the endocytosed enzyme localized to the lysosomes on immunofluorescence staining, and the endocytosis was inhibited by mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) added to the culture medium.

Enzyme replacement therapy for the infantile and juvenile forms of Pompe disease currently is undergoing clinical trials. Early diagnosis before the onset of irreversible pathology is thought to be critical for maximum efficacy of current and proposed therapies. In the absence of a family history, the presymptomatic detection of these disorders ideally can be achieved through a newborn-screening program. Currently, the clinical diagnosis of Pompe disease is confirmed by the virtual absence, in infantile onset, or a marked reduction, in juvenile and adult onset, of acid alpha-glucosidase activity in muscle biopsies and cultured fibroblasts. These assays are invasive and not suited to large-scale screening.\nMETHODS: A sensitive immune-capture enzyme activity assay for the measurement of acid alpha-glucosidase protein was developed and used to determine the activity of this enzyme in dried-blood spots from newborn and adult controls, Pompe-affected individuals, and obligate heterozygotes.\nRESULTS: Pompe-affected individuals showed an almost total absence of acid alpha-glucosidase activity in blood spots. The assay showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% for the identification of Pompe-affected individuals.\nCONCLUSIONS: The determination of acid alpha-glucosidase activity in dried-blood spots is a useful, noninvasive diagnostic assay for the identification of Pompe disease. With further validation, this procedure could be adapted for use with blood spots collected in newborn-screening programs."

Pompe disease is characterized by accumulation of lysosomal glycogen primarily in heart and skeletal muscles, which leads to progressive muscle weakness. We have shown previously that the small molecule pharmacological chaperone AT2220 (1-deoxynojirimycin hydrochloride, duvoglustat hydrochloride) binds and stabilizes wild-type as well as multiple mutant forms of GAA, and can lead to higher cellular levels of GAA. In this study, we examined the effect of AT2220 on mutant GAA, in vitro and in vivo, with a primary focus on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retained P545L mutant form of human GAA (P545L GAA). AT2220 increased the specific activity of P545L GAA toward both natural (glycogen) and artificial substrates in vitro. Incubation with AT2220 also increased the ER export, lysosomal delivery, proteolytic processing, and stability of P545L GAA. In a new transgenic mouse model of Pompe disease that expresses human P545L on a Gaa knockout background (Tg/KO) and is characterized by reduced GAA activity and elevated glycogen levels in disease-relevant tissues, daily oral administration of AT2220 for 4 weeks resulted in significant and dose-dependent increases in mature lysosomal GAA isoforms and GAA activity in heart and skeletal muscles. Importantly, oral administration of AT2220 also resulted in significant glycogen reduction in disease-relevant tissues. Compared to daily administration, less-frequent AT2220 administration, including repeated cycles of 4 or 5 days with AT2220 followed by 3 or 2 days without drug, respectively, resulted in even greater glycogen reductions. Collectively, these data indicate that AT2220 increases the specific activity, trafficking, and lysosomal stability of P545L GAA, leads to increased levels of mature GAA in lysosomes, and promotes glycogen reduction in situ. As such, AT2220 may warrant further evaluation as a treatment for Pompe disease."

In the present study, we have tested this hypothesis by using deoxynojirimycin and derivatives as chemical chaperones to correct the AalphaGlu deficiency in cultured fibroblasts from patients with GSDII. Four mutant phenotypes were chosen: Y455F/Y455F, P545L/P545L, 525del/R600C and D645E/R854X. In case of Y455F/Y455F and P545L/P545L, N-(n-butyl)deoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) restored the transport, maturation and activity of AalphaGlu in a dose dependent manner, while it had no effect on the reference enzyme beta-hexosaminidase. NB-DNJ promoted export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the lysosomes and stabilized the activity of mutant AalphaGlu species, Y455F and P545L, inside the lysosomes. In long-term culture, the AalphaGlu activity in the fibroblasts from the patients with mutant phenotypes, Y455F/Y455F and P545L/P545L, increased up to 14.0- and 7.9-fold, respectively, in the presence of 10mumol/L NB-DNJ. However, the effect of NB-DNJ on Y455F/Y455F subsided quickly after removal of the compound. We conclude that NB-DNJ acts in low concentration as chemical chaperone for certain mutant forms of AalphaGlu that are trapped in the ER, poorly transported or labile in the lysosomal environment.

We evaluated the progression of neuropathologic and behavioral abnormalities in a Pompe disease mouse model (6neo/6neo) that displays many features of the human disease. Homozygous mutant mice store excess glycogen within large neurons of hindbrain, spinal cord, and sensory ganglia by the age of 1 month; accumulations then spread progressively within many CNS cell types. \"Silver degeneration\" and Fluoro-Jade C stains revealed severe degeneration in axon terminals of primary sensory neurons at 3 to 9 months. These abnormalities were accompanied by progressive behavioral impairment on rotorod, wire hanging, and foot fault tests. The extensive neuropathologic alterations in this model suggest that therapy of skeletal and cardiac muscle disorders by systemic enzyme replacement therapy may not be sufficient to reverse functional deficits due to CNS glycogen storage, particularly early-onset, rapidly progressive disease.

We have addressed the issue of reversibility of the disease in the Gaa(-/-) mouse model. We have made transgenic lines expressing human GAA in skeletal and cardiac muscle of Gaa(-/-) mice, and we turned the transgene on at different stages of disease progression by using a tetracycline-controllable system. We have demonstrated that levels of 20-30% of normal activity are indeed sufficient to clear glycogen in the heart of young Gaa(-/-) mice, but not in older mice with a considerably higher glycogen load. However, in skeletal muscle-a major organ affected in infantile and in milder, late-onset variants in humans-induction of GAA expression in young Gaa(-/-) mice to levels greatly exceeding wildtype values did not result in full phenotypic correction, and some muscle fibers showed little or no glycogen clearance.

Thus the cEDS patients have pathological connective tissue morphology and low stiffness, but the rate of connective tissue protein turnover is unknown. We investigated whether cEDS affected the protein synthesis rate in skin and tendon, and whether this could be stimulated in tendon tissue with insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Five patients with cEDS and 10 healthy, matched controls (CTRL) were included. One patellar tendon of each participant was injected with 0.1 ml IGF-I (Increlex, Ipsen, 10 mg/ml) and the contralateral tendon with 0.1 ml isotonic saline as control. The injections were performed at both 24 and 6 h prior to tissue sampling. The fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of proteins in skin and tendon was measured with the stable isotope technique using a flood-primed continuous infusion over 6 h. After the infusion one skin biopsy and two tendon biopsies (one from each patellar tendon) were obtained. We found similar baseline FSR values in skin and tendon in the cEDS patients and controls [skin: 0.005 \u00b1 0.002 (cEDS) and 0.007 \u00b1 0.002 (CTRL); tendon: 0.008 \u00b1 0.001 (cEDS) and 0.009 \u00b1 0.002 (CTRL) %/h, mean \u00b1 SE]. IGF-I injections significantly increased FSR values in cEDS patients but not in controls (delta values: cEDS 0.007 \u00b1 0.002, CTRL 0.001 \u00b1 0.001%/h). In conclusion, baseline protein synthesis rates in connective tissue appeared normal in cEDS patients, and the patients responded with an increased tendon protein synthesis rate to IGF-I injections."

Furthermore, affected individuals are reported to experience a more severe clinical course.\nAIMS: It was hypothesised that CF is under diagnosed in people of South Asian origin and therefore the prevalence may be higher than previously estimated.\nMETHODS: The prevalence of CF in the South Asian and in the general population living in the same geographic region (Metropolitan Toronto) were compared between 1996 and 2001. Population data were obtained from the Canadian census survey. CF phenotype and genotype data were obtained from the Toronto CF database.\nRESULTS: Among 381 patients with CF, 15 were of South Asian descent. The age related prevalence of CF among the South Asian and general populations was: 0-14 years, 1:9200 versus 1:6600; 15-24 years, 1:13,200 versus 1:7600; older than 25 years, 1:56,600 versus 1:12,400. Age at diagnosis, duration and severity of symptoms at diagnosis, current nutritional status, and FEV(1) were similar in the two groups. While not significant, FEV1 tended to be lower (48% versus 57% predicted) among adult South Asians, compared to the general CF population. Also, the percentage with pancreatic sufficiency was higher (27% versus 16%) and the frequency of DeltaF508 allele was lower (50% versus 65.1%).\nCONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the prevalence and natural history of CF in South Asians is similar to that among individuals of European origin. The relatively lower prevalence among older South Asians may reflect an improving recognition of CF in this ethnic subgroup."

We found that the CF mutations D1152H, W1089X, and 405 + IG-->A were present in some ethnic groups in which no CF patients carrying these mutations were reported. These facts necessitate a reevaluation of the screening policy regarding the ethnic groups in Israel. We studied 9,430 healthy Jewish Israeli individuals of 36 countries of origin. The prevalence of CF mutations was 1:19, 1:19, 1:28, and 1:42 for the Ashkenazi, Sephardi, North African, and Eastern Jews, respectively. CF mutations were identified in 374 (4.0%) individuals.

She had a history of bilateral recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax. Physical examination showed reduced pulmonary sounds on the right side. Chest X-ray confirmed the diagnosis of recurrent right-sided pneumothorax. Computed tomography showed multiple bilateral bullae. Video-assisted pleurectomy, bulla resection, and bulla coagulation were performed. The diagnosis of pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis was confirmed by pulmonary biopsy. After pleurectomy, the patient remained symptom-free without recurrent pneumothorax.\nCONCLUSION: Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare cause of recurrent pneumothorax and should be considered a differential diagnosis, especially in young women with diffuse bilateral bullous emphysema or tuberous sclerosis."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the cardiac and neurodevelopmental outcomes of fetal rhabdomyoma.\nMETHODS: We reviewed the clinical characteristics of 23 cases of cardiac rhabdomyoma diagnosed prenatally by fetal echocardiography at the Asan Medical Center between January 1998 and December 2009. We also reviewed postnatal results of brain magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, renal ultrasound examination and molecular genetic analysis to confirm the presence of cardiac rhabdomyoma with or without TSC.\nRESULTS: Among 23 cases, outcome data were available for 17 (73.9%) and six cases (26.1%) were lost to follow-up. The survival rate was 100.0% (17/17). Among the 17 cases with outcome data, spontaneous tumor regression occurred in eight (47.1%), and no change in tumor size and number was observed in the remaining nine cases (52.9%). There was no evidence of long-term cardiac dysfunction caused by persisting rhabdomyomas, regardless of tumor size. TSC was found in nine patients (52.9%), of whom five (55.6%) showed neurodevelopmental morbidity. We identified mutations in one of the TSC1 or TSC2 genes in four of nine TSC infants whose parents allowed us to perform molecular genetic analysis. Three of these (75.0%) were found to have neurologic impairment. Seven (77.8%) of nine TSC cases were non-familial.\nCONCLUSIONS: The overall outcome of isolated cardiac rhabdomyoma appears to be favorable. We suggest that systematic postnatal evaluation of TSC be performed even in cases of cardiac rhabdomyoma without a family history of TSC. Molecular characterization of TSC1 and TSC2 might be helpful in predicting short- and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes."

Previous descriptions of clinical characteristics of subjects with lymphangioleiomyomatosis have been based on a limited number of patients.\nOBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics of subjects with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, both sporadic and tuberous sclerosis-related forms.\nMETHODS: Over a 3-yr period, from 1998 to 2001, 243 subjects with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis were enrolled into a national registry; 13 subjects who had already undergone lung transplantation were excluded for the purposes of this report.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All 230 subjects were women, aged 18 to 76 yr (mean +/- SE, 44.5 +/- 0.65 yr). The average age at onset of symptoms was 38.9 +/- 0.73 yr and at diagnosis was 41.0 +/- 0.65 yr. Tuberous sclerosis complex was present in 14.8% of subjects. Pulmonary manifestations, most commonly spontaneous pneumothorax, were the primary events leading to the diagnosis in 86.5% of cases. Nearly 55% of the subjects were being treated with a progesterone derivative. An obstructive pattern on pulmonary function testing was observed in 57.3% of the subjects, whereas 33.9% had normal spirometric results. Women with tuberous sclerosis-related lymphangioleiomyomatosis were younger and had less impaired lung function compared with those with the sporadic form.\nCONCLUSIONS: The age range of women afflicted with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis is broader than previously appreciated and the degree of pulmonary function can be quite variable, with one-third of subjects having normal spirometry at enrollment into this registry."

Prognostic information in LAM has been limited by small numbers and heterogeneous study methodology. Early retrospective cohorts cited 5- and 10-year mortality of 40 and 80 %, respectively. More recently, mortality at 10 years has been estimated to be approximately 10-20 % from the onset of symptoms and 30 % at 10 years from the time of lung biopsy but varies widely in individual patients. Given the heterogeneous disease course, it would be useful to establish which clinical characteristics are associated with survival to develop prediction models for disease outcome.\nMETHODS: The LAM Foundation maintains a population-based registry of 1,149 registered self-identified LAM patients. Of these, 590 have completed a \"General Information/Clinical History Questionnaire\" with limited demographic and clinical data, 410 of whom were identified as U.S. residents and provided date of birth. Vital status was obtained on all 410 participants through December 31, 2007 by linking patient identifiers and the National Death Index. Survival time was calculated as the time since first lung-related symptom or physician diagnosis until censoring (still alive, received lung transplant, or died). Cox proportional hazard analysis evaluated the association of demographic and clinical features with survival.\nRESULTS: Among the 410 subjects, there were 50 deaths and 55 lung transplantations during a median of 10.4 years of observation time. The estimated median transplant-free survival time for LAM patients in the United States is 29 years from symptom onset and 23 years from diagnosis. The estimated 10-year survival transplant-free was 86 %. Age at disease onset, smoking status, race, presence of tuberous sclerosis, occurrence of pneumothorax, and pregnancy did not demonstrate an association with survival or transplant. Greater age at presentation and presence of angiomyolipoma were associated with less risk of mortality. Treatment with hormonal therapy was associated with an increased risk of death/transplant (hazard ratio (HR) 2.93; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.54-5.58; p = 0.001), particularly progesterone therapy (HR 2.17; 95 % CI 1.26-3.75, p = 0.005), and may represent confounding by indication. Patients who required oxygen therapy had a worse outcome (HR 4.53; 95 % CI 2.76-7.42; p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our population-based study showed that the median survival in patients with LAM from the onset of symptoms or diagnosis is much longer than previously described. This has important implications for life choices and treatment decisions regarding medication use and lung transplantation for patients with LAM."

A retrospective review of our patient population that had comprehensive testing for mutations in TSC1/TSC2 identified 23/157 (15%) that were NMI. NMI patients had a lower incidence of brain findings on imaging studies, neurological features, and renal findings than those with TSC2 mutations.

From patient charts we collected data about age at epilepsy onset, seizure frequency and seizure type, history of infantile spasms (IS), epileptic syndrome, evolution to refractory epilepsy or to seizure freedom and/or medication freedom, electroencephalography (EEG) features, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, cognitive outcome, and genetic background.\nKEY FINDINGS: Among the 160 subjects (120 adults and 40 children), 116 (72.5%) had epilepsy: 57 (35.6%) were seizure-free, and 59 (36.9%) had drug-resistant epilepsy. Most seizure-free patients had a focal epilepsy (89.5%), with 54.4% of them drug resistant for a period of their lives. Epilepsy onset in the first year of life with IS and/or focal seizures was characteristic of the drug-resistant group of patients, as well as cognitive impairment and TSC2 mutation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). A small group of patients (7 patients, 4.4%) experienced a seizure only once; all of them had normal cognition.\nSIGNIFICANCE: Although epilepsy management can be challenging in TSC, more than one third of patients had their seizures controlled: through monotherapy in 56% and by polytherapy in 32%. Moreover, 12% of the patients became seizure-free and were off medication. Identifying predictive features of epilepsy and cognitive outcome can ensure better management for patients with TSC and delineate genotype-phenotype correlations."

Whether this intriguing cell type results from similar pathogenetic pathways remains to be shown. Here, we analyzed the immunohistochemical distribution pattern of the CD34 epitope in surgical specimens from 34 patients with FCD IIb, compared to that of 6 patients with TSC and 3 patients with HME. In normal brain, CD34 occurs only transiently during neurulation, but cannot be detected in mature neuroectodermal cell progenies. In contrast, 58% of our patients showed CD34 immunoreactivity within a subpopulation of balloon cells. Interestingly, CD34-positive balloon cells were confined to the white matter, but never observed in neocortical layers. Furthermore, balloon cells expressing neurofilament protein were also restricted to white matter, whereas GFAP-positive balloon cells were observed either in white or gray matter location. Clinical characteristics did not significantly differ between patients with CD34-positive versus CD34-negative lesions. No significant correlation was found between CD34 expression and genetic alterations of the TSC1 gene, which is affected in many FCD and TSC patients and which plays a role in the regulation of cell size. Further studies are warranted to clarify the restricted expression of CD34 in balloon cells of the white matter."

The vast majority of these tumors arise from the lateral ependymal surface adjacent to the foramen of Monro, therefore potentially encroaching on one or both foramina, and resulting in obstructive hydrocephalus that necessitates surgical decompression. The indications for surgery, intraoperative considerations, and evolution of the authors' management paradigm are presented.\nMETHODS: Patients with TSC who underwent craniotomy for SEGA resection at New York University Langone Medical Center between January 1997 and March 2011 were identified. Preoperative imaging, clinical characteristics, management decisions, operative procedures, and outcomes were reviewed.\nRESULTS: Eighteen patients with TSC underwent 22 primary tumor resections for SEGAs. The indication for surgery was meaningful radiographic tumor progression in 16 of 21 cases. The average age at the time of operation was 10.3 years. Average follow-up duration was 52 months (range 12-124 months). The operative approach was intrahemispheric-transcallosal in 16 cases, transcortical-transventricular in 5, and neuroendoscopic in 1. Nine tumors were on the right, 9 on the left, and 3 were bilateral. Gross-total resection was documented in 16 of 22 cases in our series, with radical subtotal resection achieved in 4 cases, and subtotal resection (STR) in 2 cases. Two patients had undergone ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement preoperatively and 7 patients required shunt placement after surgery for moderate to severe ventriculomegaly. Two patients experienced tumor progression requiring reoperation; both of these patients had initially undergone STR.\nCONCLUSIONS: The authors present their management strategy for TSC patients with SEGAs. Select patients underwent microsurgical resection of SEGAs with acceptable morbidity. Gross-total resection or radical STR was achieved in 90.9% of our series (20 of 22 primary tumor resections), with no recurrences in this group. Approximately half of our patient series required CSF diversionary procedures. There were no instances of permanent neurological morbidity associated with surgery."

We evaluated 22 patients with the pathological diagnosis of SGCA. The diagnosis was made at a median of 10.1 years old. We were able to observe the evolution of SN to ASGC: these SN were localized adjacent to the foramen of Monro and with time they underwent an important development with intense contrast enhancement and hydrocephalus. The acceleration in SN growth and its \"transformation\" into SGCA occurred at an average of 10 years of age, with a mean diameter of 9 mm. No SN located far from the foramen of Monro evolutioned to SGCA. Fifteen patients (68%) were operated with symptoms of intracranial hypertension. Average age at surgery was 10.8 years old. Six patients presented visual deficit and in these, the average diameter of the tumor was 31.5 mm, a high value when compared to 18.7 mm in the patients without visual deficit. The imaging and clinical follow-up of any subependymal lesion close to the foramen of Monro will permit, at a presymptomatic stage, an anticipation of surgical treatment thus reducing intracranial hypertension incidence. Prospective studies could determine whether the SN-SGCA complex corresponds to the same entity in distinct evolution stages or to two lesions with different growth potential."

In MFS serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) can occur. The aim of this prospective study was to reveal underlying risk factors and to prospectively investigate the association between MFS and SCD in a long-term follow-up.\nMETHODS: 77 patients with MFS were included. At baseline serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), transthoracic echocardiogram, 12-lead resting ECG, signal-averaged ECG (SAECG) and a 24-h Holter ECG with time- and frequency domain analyses were performed. The primary composite endpoint was defined as SCD, ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF) or arrhythmogenic syncope.\nRESULTS: The median follow-up (FU) time was 868 days. Among all risk stratification parameters, NT-proBNP remained the exclusive predictor (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1 to 4.62, p=0.01) for the composite endpoint. With an optimal cut-off point at 214.3 pg/ml NT-proBNP predicted the composite primary endpoint accurately (AUC 0.936, p=0.00046, sensitivity 100%, specificity 79.0%). During FU, seven patients of Group 2 (NT-proBNP \u2265 214.3 pg/ml) reached the composite endpoint and 2 of these patients died due to SCD. In five patients, sustained VT was documented. All patients with a NT-proBNP<214.3 pg/ml (Group 1) experienced no events. Group 2 patients had a significantly higher risk of experiencing the composite endpoint (logrank-test, p<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: In contrast to non-invasive electrocardiographic parameter, NT-proBNP independently predicts adverse arrhythmogenic events in patients with MFS."

Using antisense oligonucleotides (AONs), the disrupted DMD reading frame is restored, allowing generation of partially functional dystrophin and conversion of a severe Duchenne into a milder Becker muscular dystrophy phenotype. In vivo studies are mainly performed using 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate (2OMePS) or morpholino (PMO) AONs. These compounds were never directly compared.\nMETHODS: mdx and humanized (h)DMD mice were injected intramuscularly and intravenously with short versus long 2OMePS and PMO for mouse exon 23 and human exons 44, 45, 46 and 51.\nRESULTS: Intramuscular injection showed that increasing the length of 2OMePS AONs enhanced skipping efficiencies of human exon 45, but decreased efficiency for mouse exon 23. Although PMO induced more mouse exon 23 skipping, PMO and 2OMePS were more comparable for human exons. After intravenous administration, exon skipping and novel protein was shown in the heart with both chemistries. Furthermore, PMO showed lower intramuscular concentrations with higher exon 23 skipping levels compared to 2OMePS, which may be due to sequestration in the extracellular matrix. Finally, two mismatches rendered 2OMePS but not PMO AONs nearly ineffective.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in the present study indicate that increasing AON length improves skipping efficiency in some but not all cases. It is feasible to induce exon skipping and dystrophin restoration in the heart after injection of 2OMePS and unconjugated PMO. Furthermore, differences in efficiency between PMO and 2OMePS appear to be sequence and not chemistry dependent. Finally, the results indicate that PMOs may be less sequence specific than 2OMePS."

We now show that this dystrophin expression was accompanied by an elevated expression of \u03b1-sarcoglycan, \u03b2-dystroglycan (BDG) and--in relevant cases--neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) at the sarcolemma, each of which is a component of a different subcomplex of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DAPC). As expected, nNOS expression was relocalized to the sarcolemma in Duchenne patients in whom the dystrophin deletion left the nNOS-binding domain (exons 42-45) intact, whereas this did not occur in patients with deletions that involved this domain. Our results indicate that the novel internally deleted and shorter dystrophin induced by skipping exon 51 in patients with amenable deletions, can also restore the dystrophin-associated complex, further suggesting preserved functionality of the newly translated dystrophin."

No cure exists for this disease and a number of promising new molecular therapies are being intensively studied. Duchenne muscular dystrophy arises due to mutations that disrupt the open-reading-frame in the DMD gene leading to the absence of the essential muscle protein dystrophin. Of all novel molecular interventions currently being investigated for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, perhaps the most promising method aiming to restore dystrophin expression to diseased cells is known as 'exon skipping' or splice-modulation, whereby antisense oligonucleotides eliminate the deleterious effects of DMD mutations by modulating dystrophin pre-messenger RNA splicing, such that functional dystrophin protein is produced. Recently this method was shown to be promising and safe in clinical trials both in The Netherlands and the UK. These trials studied direct antisense oligonucleotide injections into single peripheral lower limb muscles, whereas a viable therapy will need antisense oligonucleotides to be delivered systemically to all muscles, most critically to the heart, and ultimately to all other affected tissues including brain.

Using antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting specific exons the DMD reading frame is restored and partially functional dystrophins are produced. Following proof of concept in cultured muscle cells from patients with various deletions and point mutations, we now focus on single and multiple exon duplications. These mutations are in principle ideal targets for this approach since the specific skipping of duplicated exons would generate original, full-length transcripts.\nMETHODS: Cultured muscle cells from DMD patients carrying duplications were transfected with AONs targeting the duplicated exons, and the dystrophin RNA and protein were analyzed.\nRESULTS: For two brothers with an exon 44 duplication, skipping was, even at suboptimal transfection conditions, so efficient that both exons 44 were skipped, thus generating, once more, an out-of-frame transcript. In such cases, one may resort to multi-exon skipping to restore the reading frame, as is shown here by inducing skipping of exon 43 and both exons 44. By contrast, in cells from a patient with an exon 45 duplication we were able to induce single exon 45 skipping, which allowed restoration of wild type dystrophin. The correction of a larger duplication (involving exons 52 to 62), by combinations of AONs targeting the outer exons, appeared problematic due to inefficient skipping and mistargeting of original instead of duplicated exons.\nCONCLUSION: The correction of DMD duplications by exon skipping depends on the specific exons targeted. Its options vary from the ideal one, restoring for the first time the true, wild type dystrophin, to requiring more 'classical' skipping strategies, while the correction of multi-exon deletions may need the design of tailored approaches."

TSC1 markers showed different maternal and paternal haplotypes in affected children, excluding a mutation in TSC1 as the cause of the disease. For the TSC2 markers all the affected children had the same maternal and paternal haplotypes, as did three of their unaffected siblings. Mutation screening by RT-PCR and direct sequencing of the TSC2 gene identified a 4 bp insertion TACT following nucleotide 2077 in exon 18 which was present in the three affected children but not in five unaffected siblings or the parents. This mutation would cause a frameshift and premature termination at codon 703. Absence of the mutation in lymphocyte DNA from the parents was consistent with germline mosaicism and this was confirmed by our finding of identical chromosome 16 haplotypes in affected and unaffected siblings, providing unequivocal evidence of two different cell lines in the gametes. Molecular analysis of the TSC2 alleles present in the affected subjects showed that the mutation had been inherited from the mother. This is the first case of germline mosaicism in tuberous sclerosis proven by molecular genetic analysis and also the first example of female germline mosaicism for a characterized autosomal dominant gene mutation apparently not associated with somatic mosaicism."

There are several case reports of solitary SEGA without any other manifestations of TSC. Usually these cases are thought to be forme fruste of TSC due to somatic mosaicism. However, no previous reports have used molecular methodology to fully investigate mutations in TSC genes or the possibility of somatic mosaicism. Here, we report a 20-year-old woman with a brain tumor. Pathological diagnosis was consistent with SEGA, but comprehensive clinical screening found no other lesions indicative of TSC. Molecular analysis of the tumor revealed loss of heterozygosity and allelic mutation (5228G>A, R1743Q) of TSC2. To detect the small fraction of mosaic mutation in somatic cells, we developed a highly sensitive new method: triple-nested polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The identical TSC2 missense mutation was not detected in any other tissues from the same patient, including peripheral blood, buccal mucosa, urinary sediment, nail, and hair. According to these results, this patient should be considered as having SEGA that developed from two somatic hit mutations in TSC2, rather than being a TSC2 patient with a very small fraction of somatic mosaicism."

AF508 is the most frequent mutation worldwide and it consists in a deletion of the codon that encodes fenilalanine at the 508 protein's position. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of the delta F508 mutation in Venezuelan patients with CF using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). We studied thirty patients of twenty eight families who were diagnosed with CF based on their clinical features and sweat chloride level > 60 mEq/l in two determinations. Detection of the mutation was performed from the amplification of a 98 pair of bases (pb) CF gene segment which contains the codon that encodes fenilalanine in the 508 position by PCR. This PCR product is absent in those who have the mutation. The delta F508 allelic frequency was 26.79%, distributed in six homozygous and seven compound heterozygote delta F508/X. The reminder mutations (no delta F508) represent 73.21%. The delta F508 frequency in our sample is less than the reported in European countries. On the other hand, a delta F508 frequency highly heterogeneous has been observed in Latin-American countries. This variation results from mixed populations with a different genetic background influenced by external migration and CF molecular alterations, which exists in the analyzed populations. In this study, the delta F508 mutation comes mainly from grandparents (79.41%) who were born in Mediterranean countries and Colombia, while the no delta F508 mutations come from grandparents who were born in Venezuela (79.27%) and Colombia (17.07%)."

The most common inherited disease among Caucasians is cystic fibrosis (CF). Although no careful scientific study had ever been done the impression was that CF was extremely rare among the Greek-Cypriots, with an incidence estimated at around 1:30,000. About 2 years ago, we introduced molecular diagnostic methodology in an effort to assist clinicians in safer diagnosis of patients presenting with atypical CF symptomatology, and also for testing the hypothesis that mutations that cause milder phenotypes might be responsible for misdiagnosis or for missing entirely some cases of CF. Initial screening for delta F508 revealed that it is indeed rare in the general population. Further screening of suspected CF patients revealed a novel mutation that converted leucine at position 346 to proline (L346P) in two unrelated families. The second CF mutation was delta F508 and 1677delTA in the two families respectively, both reportedly associated with severe phenotypes. Yet our patients did not present with typical CF pictures possibly because of the dominant nature of this novel mild mutation in exon 7. Symptoms included failure to thrive, chest infections and electrolyte disturbances. These findings raise the possibility that Cyprus might have been spared very severe CF phenotypes but not cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations."

The incidence of CF in non-Caucasian populations is low. Intensive efforts using genetic linkage information ultimately led to the cloning of the CF gene prior to the identification of the gene product or its function. The gene encodes what is believed to be a transmembrane protein, which has been named the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The CFTR contains two nucleotide-binding folds (NBF) which show homology to numerous transport proteins with the greatest homology to the P-glycoproteins that are encoded by the multiple drug-resistance loci. A three- base deletion resulting in the loss of phenylalanine residue (delta F508) in the tenth exon of the CFTR gene is the mutation occurring on the majority of CF chromosomes. The overall frequency of delta F508 in the present mutant CF gene pool is about 70%, but the study populations are not equally represented: there is marked variation in the population of delta F508 among different geographic populations. Recently, numerous additional, less common mutations have been found. Some mutations occur on 2-5% of the CF chromosomes. Many of these are rare 'private' mutations, occurring in individual families of all racial and ethnic backgrounds. By contrast over 80% of Western European CF mutations have been identified. The highly heterogeneous nature of the remaining CF mutations provides important insights into the structure and function of the protein, but further improvements are needed in DNA-based genetic screening for CF carrier status."

To our knowledge, there are no studies on protein localization in the different cell types of the seminiferous epithelium with different pathologies. The aim of the present study was to analyze the expression of the CFTR protein in the human seminiferous epithelium of infertile males with different pathologies. CFTR protein expression was studied by immunohistochemistry in paraffin sections of testicular biopsies of six infertile men: Sertoli cell only syndrome, maturation arrest, secondary obstructive azoospermia, primary obstructive azoospermia due to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), severe oligozoospermia, and retrograde ejaculation. All cell types of the seminiferous epithelium were studied: Sertoli cells, spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes at the leptotene/zygotene and at the pachytene stages, secondary spermatocytes, round, elongating and elongated spermatids, and spermatozoa. With the exception of sperm, all cells were labeled in the cytoplasm and in the cytoplasmic membrane. In the patient with CBAVD labeling was light at the cell membrane and absent in the cytoplasm of Sertoli cells and diploid germ cells. Generally, labeling was stronger after the diploid stage, which is probably related to cell volume reduction during spermiogenesis. The results obtained also suggest that the CFTR protein may impact CBAVD spermatogenesis and other pathologies."

The prevalence of CFRD progressively increases from 9% below the age of 10 years to 43% above the age of 30 years, with reported annual age-dependent incidence rates ranging from 4% to 9%. The onset of CFRD is insidious and annual screening using the standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) from the age of 10 years has been recommended. However, OGTT thresholds for the diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance and CFRD were derived from epidemiological studies of non-CF patients and it is uncertain whether they are appropriate for patients with CF. The ability of OGTT alone to detect early abnormalities in blood glucose regulation has been questioned. Continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) may augment the screening and diagnosis of CFRD, as well as guide and monitor its management. Subcutaneous insulin therapy is currently recommended for the treatment of CFRD. Early use of insulin therapy might improve weight gain and lung function of CF patients, including those with normal OGTT results. It is still not clear when insulin therapy should be started, possibly reflecting the difficulties in detecting early but clinically relevant abnormalities in blood glucose metabolism among CF patients. We review the current evidence which highlight these diagnostic and management challenges in CFRD."

Diagnostic facilities in form of sweat chloride estimation and genetic studies are not available readily. Mutation profile is different. The frequency of common mutation F508del in Indian children is between 19% and 34%. Other mutations are heterogeneous. Management of CF in India is difficult due to less number of trained manpower, limited availability, and high cost of pharmacologic agents. The determinants of early death include: severe malnutrition and colonization with Pseudomonas at the time of diagnosis, more than four episodes of lower respiratory infection per year and age of onset of symptoms before 2 months of age.

The distribution of the mutations ranges widely between countries and/or ethnic groups. Multicentric studies are usually needed to study the genotype-phenotype correlations.\nMETHODS: Since 1992, the French CF Registry (FCFR) has collected and analyzed data from most of the CF patients regularly seen in CF care centres in France. We compared the mutation distribution of the patients born in western France to that of those born elsewhere in France. Then we extracted the available data for all the compound heterozygotes carrying the DeltaF508 allele and one of the following mutations: DeltaI507, 1078delT, 4005+1G->A, E60X and W846X, and matched a patient homozygous for the DeltaF508 mutation for each of them.\nRESULTS: Western France appeared to have a specific distribution of some CF mutations. Furthermore, disparities were found regarding the mutation repartition (DeltaI507 in Normandy, 1078delT, 4005+1G->A and W846X in western Brittany). Genotype-phenotype correlations showed a wide heterogeneity. Although variations were found, DeltaI507/DeltaF508, 4005+1G->A/DeltaF508 and 1078delT/DeltaF508 patients appeared to have a similar disease as the DeltaF508/DeltaF508 patients. Although the W846X and E60X mutations should be considered as severe alleles as regards to pancreatic function, they were associated with less severe pulmonary manifestations and, probably, better prognosis.\nCONCLUSION: The knowledge of the distribution of uncommon CF mutations specific to particular areas and of their associated phenotype makes up an essential tool in the management of local CF patients."

The Jewish population around the world is comprised of two major ethnic groups; Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi. The latter is further classified according to country of origin. In this study, we analyzed the incidence of CF and the distribution of CF mutations in the general Jewish population in Israel and in most of the Jewish ethnic subgroups. The disease frequency varies considerably among the latter. Among Ashkenazi Jews, the frequency of CF is 1:3300, which is similar to the frequency in most Caucasian populations. Among non-Ashkenazi Jews, the disease occurs at a similar frequency among Jews from Libya (1:2700), Georgia (1:2700), Greece and Bulgaria (1:2400), but is rare in Jews from Yemen (1:8800), Morocco (1:15000), Iraq (1:32000), and Iran (1:39000). So far, only 12 mutations have been identified in Israeli Jews, and this enables the identification of 91% of the CF chromosomes in the entire Jewish CF population. However, in each Jewish ethnic group, the disease is caused by a different repertoire of mutations. The frequency of identified mutations is high in Ashkenazi Jews (95%), and in Jews originating from Tunisia (100%), Libya (91%), Turkey (90%), and Georgia (88%). However, a lower frequency of mutations can be identified in Moroccan (85%), Egyptian (50%), and Yemenite (0%) Jews. For genetic counseling of a Jewish individual, it is necessary to calculate the residual risk according to ethnic origin. Carrier screening of healthy Jewish individuals is currently feasible for Ashkenazi Tunisian, Libyan, Turkish, and Georgian Jews. These results provide the required information for genetic counseling of Jewish CF families and screening programs of Jewish populations worldwide."

In the general population samples we found 4 individuals heterozygous for the deltaF508 mutation (allele frequency of 0.4%). This frequency was lower than that found in the state of Rio de Janeiro, in southeastern Brazil, and similar to that reported for the state of Paran\u00e1, in the far south. In the CF patients we found 9 heterozygous individuals and 8 homozygous individuals (allele frequency of 8.68%) for the deltaF508 mutation. This frequency is considerably lower than the average frequency of CF in the world population and in the Brazilian CF population of European ancestry (47%). These data could be explained by the intense admixture among the population in Bahia, and they suggest a heterogeneous molecular basis for CF in this area of Brazil."

To study the genetics of CF in Finland, we used a combined molecular and genealogical approach. Out of the 20 Finnish families with a living CF patient, 19 were typed for eight closely linked restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) at the MET, D7S8, and D7S23 loci. The birthplaces of the parents and grandparents were traced using population registries. Allele and haplotype frequencies in Finland are similar to those of other European and North American populations, but are modified by sampling: two regional CF gene clusters, evidently the results of a founder effect, were identified. Generally, the gene was evenly distributed over the population, carrier frequency being estimated at approximately 1.3%. We conclude that CF in Finland is caused by the common Caucasian mutation(s), and that the low frequency of the gene can be explained by a negative sampling effect and genetic drift."

In this region, it has been documented that the incidence of cystic fibrosis reached 1/902 live births between 1975 and 1988, three times higher than the average incidence of 1/2500 live births reported in other Caucasian populations. This corresponds to a carrier rate of 1/15.\nMETHODS: Using genotyping data from the Canadian Consortium for Cystic Fibrosis Genetic Studies, this article describes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator profile of the cystic fibrosis population living in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region and compares it with cystic fibrosis populations living in three other regions of the Province of Quebec.\nRESULTS: Significant differences in allelic frequencies of common mutations (as DeltaF508, 621 + 1G>T and A455E), and in percentage of covered allele with three or six mutations, were found in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean compared to other regions. Based on this result, two mutation panels exceeding 90% sensitivity threshold are now proposed for cystic fibrosis carrier screening in this region.\nCONCLUSION: The implementation of the proposed carrier screening program could diminish the incidence of this disease in this region and allow future parents to make informed decisions about family planning."

Pulmonary complications of CF, which are the most morbid aspects of the disease, are caused by primary abnormalities in epithelial cells that lead to impaired mucociliary clearance. One potential therapeutic strategy is to reconstitute expression of the CF gene in airway epithelia by somatic gene transfer. To this end, we have developed an animal model of the human airway using bronchial xenografts and have tested the efficiency of in vivo retroviral gene transfer. Using the LacZ reporter gene, we find the efficiency of in vivo retroviral gene transfer to be dramatically dependent on the regenerative and mitotic state of the epithelium. Within an undifferentiated regenerating epithelium in which 40% of nuclei labeled with BrdU, 5-10% retroviral gene transfer was obtained. In contrast, no gene transfer was noted in a fully differentiated epithelium in which 1% of nuclei labeled with BrdU. These findings suggest that retroviral mediated gene transfer to the airway in vivo may be feasible if the proper regenerative state can be induced."

In 1989, the CF gene was isolated and characterized and the major mutation (delta F508), a 3-bp deletion that results in the loss of a phenylalanine residue at position 508, was detected. To determine the frequency of the delta F508 mutation and the predicted number of additional mutations in our population, we have undertaken a collaborative study of 215 CF patients and 175 CF parents in Switzerland. The delta F508 mutation in exon 10 has been found in 70% of the CF chromosomes, and the exon-11 mutation R553X seems to be the second most common CF mutation in our population, with a frequency of 5.3%, whereas the G551D mutation (also in exon 11) has not been detected at all. Haplotype determination of 430 CF and 175 normal chromosomes using XV-2c, KM19, MP6d-9, and J3.11 has been proven to be very helpful in providing additional carrier risk calculations: Haplotypes 1 (1221), 2 (1222), 6 (2111), and 7 (2221) increase the risk of being a carrier from 1 in 55 (haplotype 6) to 1 in 17 (haplotype 1), whereas haplotypes 3 (1122), 4 (1112), 8 (2222) and 10 (1111) lower the risk from 1 in 144 (haplotype 3) to 1 in 1678 (haplotype 10). Moreover, the mutation R553X shows strong correlation with haplotype 3, leading to the suggestion that haplotypes 1, 2, 5, and 6 may account for four additional mutations in Switzerland.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Three smaller deletions in this region have previously been reported in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome phenotype. All three deletions included SNORD116, but only two encompassed parts of SNURF-SNRPN, implicating SNORD116 as the major contributor to the Prader-Willi phenotype. Our case adds further information about genotype-phenotype correlation and supports the hypothesis that SNORD116 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome.

After initial severe hypotonia, PWS children become hyperphagic and morbidly obese, if intake is not restricted. Short stature with abnormal growth hormone secretion, hypogonadism, cognitive impairment, anxiety and behavior problems are other features. PWS is caused by lack of expression of imprinted genes in a approximately 4 mb region of chromosome band 15q11.2. Our previous translocation studies predicted a major role for the C/D box small nucleolar RNA cluster SNORD116 (PWCR1/HBII-85) in PWS. To test this hypothesis, we created a approximately 150 kb deletion of the > 40 copies of Snord116 (Pwcr1/MBII-85) in C57BL/6 mice. Snord116del mice with paternally derived deletion lack expression of this snoRNA. They have early-onset postnatal growth deficiency, but normal fertility and lifespan. While pituitary structure and somatotrophs are normal, liver Igf1 mRNA is decreased. In cognitive and behavior tests, Snord116del mice are deficient in motor learning and have increased anxiety. Around three months of age, they develop hyperphagia, but stay lean on regular and high-fat diet. On reduced caloric intake, Snord116del mice maintain their weight better than wild-type littermates, excluding increased energy requirement as a cause of hyperphagia. Normal compensatory feeding after fasting, and ability to maintain body temperature in the cold indicate normal energy homeostasis regulation. Metabolic chamber studies reveal that Snord116del mice maintain energy homeostasis by altered fuel usage. Prolonged mealtime and increased circulating ghrelin indicate a defect in meal termination mechanism. Snord116del mice, the first snoRNA deletion animal model, reveal a novel role for a non-coding RNA in growth and feeding regulation."

Whereas loss of function of the SNORD116 genes appears to be responsible for the major features of PWS, the role of the other genes is less clear. One of these genes is C15orf2, which has no orthologues in rodents, but appears to be under strong positive selection in primates. C15orf2 encodes a 1156 amino acid protein with six nuclear localisation sequences. By protein BLAST analysis and InterProScan signature recognition search, we found sequence similarity of C15orf2 to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein POM121. To determine whether C15orf2 is located at nuclear pores, we generated a stable cell line that inducibly expresses FLAG-tagged C15orf2 and performed immunocytochemical studies. We found that C15orf2 is present at the nuclear periphery, where it colocalizes with NPCs and nuclear lamins. At very high expression levels, we observed invaginations of the nuclear envelope. Extending these observations to three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy, which achieves an 8-fold improved volumetric resolution over conventional imaging, we saw that C15orf2 is located at the inner face of the nuclear envelope where it strongly associates with the NPC. In nuclear envelope isolation and fractionation experiments, we detected C15orf2 in the NPC and lamina fractions. These experiments for the first time demonstrate that C15orf2 is part of the NPC or its associated molecular networks. Based on our findings, we propose 'Nuclear pore associated protein 1' as the new name for C15orf2."

Sleep abnormalities and scoliosis are common. Growth hormone insufficiency is frequent, and replacement therapy provides improvement in growth, body composition, and physical attributes. Management is otherwise largely supportive. Consensus clinical diagnostic criteria exist, but diagnosis should be confirmed through genetic testing. Prader-Willi syndrome is due to absence of paternally expressed imprinted genes at 15q11.2-q13 through paternal deletion of this region (65-75% of individuals), maternal uniparental disomy 15 (20-30%), or an imprinting defect (1-3%). Parent-specific DNA methylation analysis will detect >99% of individuals. However, additional genetic studies are necessary to identify the molecular class. There are multiple imprinted genes in this region, the loss of which contribute to the complete phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome.

Recent data suggest that snoRNA Snord116 is important for the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) characterized by hyperphagia and obesity. The current study was conducted to assess a potential cellular link between Snord116 and phenotypes of PWS. Data from mice revealed Snord116 expression in the medial hypothalamus, particularly within nuclei that are part of feeding circuitry. High expression of Snord116 was evident in the paraventricular (PVN) and ventromedial (VMH) nuclei, but particularly prevalent in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) according to in situ hybridization. Snord116 expression level in ventral hypothalamic dissections including ARC was significantly greater (by 2-fold) than that in cortex; and its expression level in dorsal hypothalamic dissections including PVN was double that in cortex. The enhanced expression pattern of Snord116 in hypothalamic nuclei was observed at weaning and young adult stages, but less obvious neonatally when expression was significantly more widespread. Therefore the expression of Snord116 likely is regulated developmentally. These results provide a new lead for understanding the mechanism(s) related to hyperphagia and obesity symptoms in PWS patients."

FUS is a predominantly nuclear DNA- and RNA-binding protein that is involved in RNA processing. Large FUS-immunoreactive inclusions fill the perikaryon of surviving motor neurons of ALS patients carrying mutations at post-mortem. This sequestration of FUS is predicted to disrupt RNA processing and initiate neurodegeneration. Here, we demonstrate that C-terminal ALS mutations disrupt the nuclear localizing signal (NLS) of FUS resulting in cytoplasmic accumulation in transfected cells and patient fibroblasts. FUS mislocalization is rescued by the addition of the wild-type FUS NLS to mutant proteins. We also show that oxidative stress recruits mutant FUS to cytoplasmic stress granules where it is able to bind and sequester wild-type FUS. While FUS interacts with itself directly by protein-protein interaction, the recruitment of FUS to stress granules and interaction with PABP are RNA dependent. These findings support a two-hit hypothesis, whereby cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS protein, followed by cellular stress, contributes to the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates that may sequester FUS, disrupt RNA processing and initiate motor neuron degeneration."

We found that the ALS-linked FUS(R521C) mutation causes accumulation of FUS-positive SGs under oxidative stress, leading to a disruption in the release of FUS from SGs in cultured neurons. Autophagy controls the quality of proteins or organelles; therefore, we checked whether autophagy regulates FUS(R521C)-positive SGs. Interestingly, FUS(R521C)-positive SGs were colocalized to RFP-LC3-positive autophagosomes. Furthermore, FUS-positive SGs accumulated in atg5(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and in autophagy-deficient neurons. However, FUS(R521C) expression did not significantly impair autophagic degradation. Moreover, autophagy activation with rapamycin reduced the accumulation of FUS-positive SGs in an autophagy-dependent manner. Rapamycin further reduced neurite fragmentation and cell death in neurons expressing mutant FUS under oxidative stress.

TDP-43 has been identified as a component of ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions of motor neurons in ALS. We focused on the diffuse cytoplasmic TDP-43 immunoreactivity in ALS neurons, and quantitatively assessed it in comparison with skein/round TDP-43 and ubiquitin immunostaining in motor neurons of 30 sporadic ALS cases. The percentage of spinal motor neurons with cytoplasmic TDP-43 immunoreactivity was higher than that of ubiquitin-immunoreactive ones. The percentage of TDP-43-positive motor neurons was independent of neuron counts in anterior horns, while the percentage of ubiquitinated neurons was inversely correlated. Aiming to define the cytosolic localization of TDP-43, the immunoblot analysis of spinal cord and frontal cortex showed that full-length TDP-43, the 45 kDa form and ubiquitinated TDP-43 are found in the soluble inclusion-free fraction. The present data suggest that delocalization, accumulation and ubiquitination of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm of motor neurons are early dysfunctions in the cascade of the events leading to motor neuron degeneration in ALS, preceding the formation of insoluble inclusion bodies. Being cytoplasmic accumulation an ongoing event during the course of the illness, a therapeutic approach to this incurable disease can be envisaged."

Although TDP-43 has been shown to interact with translation factors, its role in protein synthesis remains unclear, and no in vivo translation targets have been reported to date. Here we provide evidence that TDP-43 associates with futsch mRNA in a complex and regulates its expression at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in Drosophila. In the context of TDP-43-induced proteinopathy, there is a significant reduction of futsch mRNA at the NMJ compared with motor neuron cell bodies where we find higher levels of transcript compared with controls. TDP-43 also leads to a significant reduction in Futsch protein expression at the NMJ. Polysome fractionations coupled with quantitative PCR experiments indicate that TDP-43 leads to a futsch mRNA shift from actively translating polysomes to nontranslating ribonuclear protein particles, suggesting that in addition to its effect on localization, TDP-43 also regulates the translation of futsch mRNA. We also show that futsch overexpression is neuroprotective by extending life span, reducing TDP-43 aggregation, and suppressing ALS-like locomotor dysfunction as well as NMJ abnormalities linked to microtubule and synaptic stabilization. Furthermore, the localization of MAP1B, the mammalian homolog of Futsch, is altered in ALS spinal cords in a manner similar to our observations in Drosophila motor neurons. Together, our results suggest a microtubule-dependent mechanism in motor neuron disease caused by TDP-43-dependent alterations in futsch mRNA localization and translation in vivo."

This process is accompanied by an alteration in the stoichiometry of NF subunit protein expression such that the steady state levels of the low molecular weight NF (NFL) mRNA levels are selectively suppressed. We have previously shown that each of TDP-43, 14-3-3 and mutant SOD1 can function as NFL mRNA 3'UTR binding proteins that directly affect the stability of NFL transcripts. In this study, we demonstrate that the interaction of TDP-43 with the NFL mRNA 3' UTR involves ribonucleotide (UG) motifs present on stem loops of the 3'UTR as well as the RRM1 and RRM2 motifs of TDP-43. Ex vivo, TDP-43, 14-3-3 and SOD1 proteins interact to modulate NFL mRNA stability, although in vivo, only TDP-43 and either mutant or wild-type SOD1 co-localize in ALS motor neurons. TDP-43 was observed to co-localize to RNA transport granules (Staufen immunoreactive) in both control and ALS spinal motor neurons. In contrast, both stress granules (TIA-1 immunoreactive) and processing bodies (P-bodies; XRN-1 immunoreactive) were more prevalent in ALS motor neurons than in controls and demonstrated strong co-localization with TDP-43. Using RNA-IP-PCR, we further demonstrate that NFL mRNA is preferentially sequestered to both stress granules and P-bodies in ALS. These data suggest that NFL mRNA processing is fundamentally altered in ALS spinal motor neurons to favour compartmentalization within both stress granules and P-bodies, and that TDP-43 plays a fundamental role in this process."

Since only the mutants, but not the endogenous wild-type FUS, are associated with stress granules under most of the stress conditions reported to date, the relationship between FUS and stress granules represents a mutant-specific phenotype and thus may be of significance in mutant-induced pathogenesis. While the association of mutant-FUS with stress granules is well established, the effect of the mutant protein on stress granules has not been examined. Here we investigated the effect of mutant-FUS on stress granule formation and dynamics under conditions of oxidative stress.\nRESULTS: We found that expression of mutant-FUS delays the assembly of stress granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response."

SGs have been linked to several pathologies including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In ALS and FTD, the majority of cases have no known etiology and exposure to external stress is frequently proposed as a contributor to either disease initiation or the rate of disease progression. Of note, both ALS and FTD are characterized by pathological inclusions, where some well-known SG markers localize with the ALS related proteins TDP-43 and FUS.

These diseases now are collectively known as the novel clinical spectrum, FUS proteinopathy. ALS-linked mutations of FUS are clustered in the C-terminal region; however, the molecular properties of mutant FUS remain unclear. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of FUS proteinopathy, we examined the biochemical and cellular characteristics of mutant FUS in expressing cells.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Expression of ALS-linked FUS mutations resulted in their assembly into cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs), cellular structures that package mRNA and RNA-binding proteins during cell stress. A deletion mutant series revealed that the C-terminal region in FUS is critical for nuclear retention via Ran guanosine triphosphatase-dependent transport machinery. A parallel study of subcellular distribution revealed that ALS-linked mutants additively disturb the function of the C-terminus for nuclear traffic, resulting in cytoplasmic accumulation and the formation of SGs.\nINTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates that mutant FUS, which is missing the nuclear traffic activity of the C-terminus, is dislocated to cytoplasm and assembled into SGs, indicating that disruption of translational regulation and metabolism of mRNA via inappropriate/excessive SGs may be crucial for FUS proteinopathies. Our findings provide new biological and pathological insights into the FUS protein that should help our understanding of the pathogenesis of ALS/FTLD."

Recently, TDP-43 has been identified as a key protein in the pathogenesis of some cases of ALS. Although the role of TDP-43 in motor neuron degeneration is not yet known, TDP-43 has been shown to accumulate in RNA stress granules (SGs) in cell models and in spinal cord tissue from ALS patients. The SG association may be an early pathological change to TDP-43 metabolism and as such a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Accumulation of TDP-43 in SGs induced by inhibition of mitochondrial activity can be inhibited by modulation of cellular kinase activity. We have also found that treatment of cells and animal models of neurodegeneration, including an ALS model, with bioavailable bis(thiosemicarbazonato)copper(II) complexes (Cu(II)(btsc)s) can modulate kinase activity and induce neuroprotective effects. In this study we examined the effect of diacetylbis(-methylthiosemicarbazonato)copper(II) (Cu(II)(atsm)) and glyoxalbis(-methylthiosemicarbazonato)copper(II) (Cu(II)(gtsm)) on TDP-43-positive SGs induced in SH-SY5Y cells in culture. We found that the Cu(II)(btsc)s blocked formation of TDP-43-and human antigen R (HuR)-positive SGs induced by paraquat. The Cu(II)(btsc)s protected neurons from paraquat-mediated cell death. These effects were associated with inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. Co-treatment of cultures with either Cu(II)(atsm) or an ERK inhibitor, PD98059 both prevented ERK activation and blocked formation of TDP-43-and HuR-positive SGs. Cu(II)(atsm) treatment or ERK inhibition also prevented abnormal ubiquitin accumulation in paraquat-treated cells suggesting a link between prolonged ERK activation and abnormal ubiquitin metabolism in paraquat stress and inhibition by Cu. Moreover, Cu(II)(atsm) reduced accumulation of C-terminal (219-414) TDP-43 in transfected SH-SY5Y cells. These results demonstrate that Cu(II)(btsc) complexes could potentially be developed as a neuroprotective agent to modulate neuronal kinase function and inhibit TDP-43 aggregation.

Eighteen members of 5 families with this deficiency have been investigated; only 3 exhibited a hemorrhagic diathesis: 2/4 homozygous (hemorrhages after surgical procedures and hematomas and after minor traumatism) and 1/10 heterozygous individuals (hematomas, epistaxis). All homozygotes had a prolongation of the PTT. The hemorrhagic tendency was higher among homozygous individuals (with very low factor XI activity), but 2 were asymptomatic. Heterozygotes may also bleed. This deficiency is found mainly in an Ashkenazy Jewish population. Our study shows that it occurs in an apparently autochthonous Swiss population. A detailed history and studies of other family members are necessary if there is suspicion of factor XI deficiency."

Therefore, the study objectives were to investigate the effects of the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline on mood, learning, central cytokine expression and skeletal muscle inflammation in mdx mice. Amitriptyline-induced effects (10\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) daily s.c. injections, 25\u00a0days) on the behaviour of mdx mice were investigated using the open field arena and tail suspension tests. The effects of chronic amitriptyline treatment on inflammatory markers were studied in the muscle and plasma of mdx mice, and mood-associated monoamine and cytokine concentrations were measured in the amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and midbrain. The mdx mice exhibited increased levels of anxiety and depressive-like behaviour compared with wild-type mice. Amitriptyline treatment had anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in mdx mice associated with elevations in serotonin levels in the amygdala and hippocampus. Inflammation in mdx skeletal muscle tissue was also reduced following amitriptyline treatment as indicated by decreased immune cell infiltration of muscle and lower levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-6 in the forelimb flexors. Interleukin-6 mRNA expression was remarkably reduced in the amygdala of mdx mice by chronic amitriptyline treatment.

We now provide a description of this GC-rich region which includes one potential YY1 element and one potential SP1 binding site. There are 13 GGC trinucleotides within the first 150 bp preceding the initiation codon. The 5' end of intron 1 contains six potential Sp1 binding sites, one AP1 binding site, and eight AP2 binding sites. A construct containing nucleotides -176 to -24 had the strongest promoter activity using a vector containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. We also provide evidence for the presence of inhibitory sequences located immediately upstream of the promoter region, and within the first 234 nucleotides of intron 1. These elements together with a suboptimal nucleotide at position +4 may explain the low level of GALC protein in all cell types."

Although most cases are diagnosed in infancy and show a fatal outcome in childhood, adult patients have been identified, showing progressive spastic hemiparesis to tetraparesis, followed by optic atrophy, dementia, and neuropathy. The disease can be diagnosed by detecting the deficiency of GALC activity (less than 5% of normal) in any available tissue sample. The cloning of the human GALC gene allowed the molecular characterization of newly diagnosed patients. More than 75 disease-causing mutations and polymorphisms in this gene have been identified.\nOBJECTIVE: To describe a 28-year-old woman with Krabbe disease, correlating clinical and biochemical abnormalities to a novel mutation on the GALC gene.\nMETHODS: Clinical investigation was enriched by neurophysiological and neuroimaging data. The activity of GALC was assayed in white blood cells using radiolabeled natural substrate. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood, and the GALC gene was sequenced. The mutated gene was expressed and GALC activity was measured in transfected COS-1 cells.\nRESULTS: The patient had progressive and bilateral amaurosis starting at 8 years of age. Although she was experiencing weakness in all her extremities, her intellect remained intact. She was found to be homozygous for a previously unreported missense mutation (T1886G), which leads to low, but not totally deficient, GALC activity.\nCONCLUSIONS: Expression of this mutation in COS-1 cells using the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) resulted in low, although not null, GALC activity, which can explain the protracted clinical course in this patient. Patients carrying the mutation described herein might be potential candidates for therapeutic trials, such as bone marrow transplantation or gene therapy."

Beta-galactocerebrosidase (GALC) is a specific beta-galactosidase which is defective in GLD. About 90% of GLD patients have an infantile course by fatal cerebral demyelination, but 10% have a later onset (LOGLD) of symptoms and survive for one or several decades.\nMETHODS: Activities of GALC towards galactosylceramide (GC) and galactosylsphingosine (psychosine; PS) were determined in white blood cells and cultured fibroblasts derived from GLD patients and controls using tritium-labelled natural substrates. In the galactosylsphingosine (psychosine) beta-galactosidase (GALC-PS) assay, a thin layer chromatographic technique was used to separate enzymatically released radioactive galactose.\nRESULTS: Both galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase (GALC-GC) and GALC-PS activities were reduced by at least 85% of the normal in all but 2 of the 10 GLD patients studied. In particular, one 23-year-old severely demyelinated LOGLD patient was strongly deficient (11% of the normal) in GALC-GC but apparently normal for GALC-PS activity. This patient's GALC genotype was the 30-kb-deleted/502T allele combined with a wild-type allele in the 1637C background known to slightly reduce GALC-GC activity. Further, of six LOGLD patients, both of 62- and 63-year-old brothers had the deleted allele combined with an 809G>A mutated 1637C allele. The sibs had strongly reduced GALC-GC and GALC-PS activities but became clinically remarkable only in their 50s with a severe mental downhill course in one of them.\nCONCLUSIONS: A GALC genotype with one deleted and one polymorphic GALC activity-reducing allele can lead to enzymatic and clinical signs of LOGLD in the absence of marked GALC-PS deficiency. If an active PS hydrolysis in the fibroblasts of a LOGLD patient also reflected such hydrolysis in the brain, the psychosine hypothesis for GLD may need to be revised."

HMGal hydrolysis at pH 4.5 is optimally stimulated by sodium taurocholate (0.25%) and oleic acid (0.05%) with a Km of 0.150, 0.04 and 0.03 mM, respectively for control mouse kidney, human fibroblasts and leukocytes. In control samples, the specific activity (nmol/mg prot./h) for HMGal is higher than for the natural substrate, galactocerebroside, and is severely deficient in the twitcher mouse and in patients with Krabbe disease. Comparative investigation of galactocerebrosidase activity in fibroblasts, leukocytes and brain with radioactive and fluorogenic substrates reveals a good agreement between the results of the two methods. Galactocerebroside (Gal-Cer) is a competitive inhibitor of HMGal hydrolysis in mouse kidney homogenates while GM1-ganglioside has no inhibitory effect in the same assay system. The sensitivity and specificity of this fluorogenic substrate for galactocerebrosidase provides a simple and rapid method for the diagnosis of Krabbe disease, and for the purification of this enzyme from normal tissues."

Psychosine is generated by galactosylation of sphingosine by UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase (CGT), a galactosylceramide synthesizing enzyme which is primarily expressed in OLs. The expression of CGT and the synthesis of galactosyl-sphingolipids are associated with the terminal differentiation of OL, but little is known about the participation of endogenous psychosine accumulation in OL differentiation under GALC deficient conditions. In this study, we report that accumulation of endogenous psychosine under GALC deficient Krabbe conditions impedes OL differentiation process both by decreasing the expression of myelin lipids and protein and by inducing the cell death of maturating OLs. The psychosine pathology under GALC deficient conditions involves participation of secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activation and increase in its metabolites, as evidenced by attenuation of psychosine-induced pathology by treatment with pharmacological inhibitor of sPLA2 7,7-dimethyleicosadienoic acid (DEDA). These observations suggest for potential therapeutic efficacy of sPLA2 inhibitor in Krabbe disease."

Clinical signs of tremors, hypertonia, and incoordination led to humane euthanasia by 5 months of age. At necropsy, peripheral nerves were enlarged. Microscopically, the cerebral, cerebellar, and spinal cord white matter was infiltrated with periodic acid-Schiff-positive multinucleated globoid cells, and there was a striking lack of myelin. Peripheral nerve fibers were decreased in number and separated by Alcian blue- and safranin O-positive material. Myelin sheaths were greatly diminished. Lipid analysis of brains of 12-day-old and 158-day-old affected monkeys revealed a great excess of psychosine in white matter.

The deficiency results in decreased lysosomal catabolism of certain galactolipids including galactosylceramide and psychosine that are synthesized maximally during myelination. According to current theories, the accumulation of psychosine in humans and animals with GLD induces oligodendrocyte degeneration and myelination ceases. Transduction of oligodendrocytes from twitcher mice with a retroviral vector containing the GALC cDNA can correct the enzyme deficiency in these cells. Our data show that twitcher astrocytes and oligodendrocytes can internalize exogenous GALC, as well as donate the enzyme to the mutant glial cells. Antibodies against human GALC localized the GALC antigen in retrovirally transduced cells and cells receiving enzyme via cell to cell secretion and uptake to the lysosomal fraction. In fact immunocytochemical studies in transduced oligodendrocytes revealed that the GALC colocalizes in vesicles lysosomal-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP2) (+). Moreover, labeling cells with anti-GALC and a marker for oligodendrocytes demonstrated that, upon differentiation, transduced, twitcher oligodendrocytes attained the normal branched process configuration, while untransduced cells show only abnormal morphology. Phenotype correction in mutant oligodendrocytes has also been observed after enzyme transfer.

We have analyzed the galactocerebrosidase gene in 17 patients (nine families) with late-onset GLD and in 1 patient with classical Krabbe disease. Half of the patients were heterozygous for the large gene deletion associated with the 502C-->T polymorphism, the most common mutation in infantile patients.

They include the missense mutations R63H, G95S, M101L, G268S, Y298C, and I234T; the nonsense mutation S7X; a one-base deletion (805delG); a mutation that interferes with the splicing of intron 1; and a 34-nt insertion in the RNA, caused by the aberrant splicing of intron 6. All of these genetic defects are clustered in the first 10 exons of the galactocerebrosidase gene and therefore affect the 50-kD subunit of the mature enzyme.

Although historically 85%-90% of symptomatic individuals with Krabbe disease diagnosed by enzyme activity alone have infantile-onset Krabbe disease and 10%-15% have later-onset Krabbe disease, the experience with newborn screening (NBS) suggests that the proportion of individuals with possible later-onset Krabbe disease is higher than previously thought. Infantile-onset Krabbe disease is characterized by normal development in the first few months followed by rapid severe neurologic deterioration; the average age of death is 24 months (range 8 months to 9 years). Later-onset Krabbe disease is much more variable in its presentation and disease course.\nDIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The two diagnostic scenarios are the following: Scenario 1. The diagnosis of Krabbe disease, suspected in a symptomatic proband based on clinical findings (by age) and other supportive laboratory, neuroimaging, and electrophysiologic findings, is established by detection of deficient GALC enzyme activity in leukocytes. Abnormal results require follow-up molecular genetic testing of GALC; elevated psychosine levels can also help establish the diagnosis. Scenario 2. In an asymptomatic newborn with low GALC enzyme activity on dried blood spot specimens on NBS urgent time-critical measurement of blood psychosine levels and GALC molecular genetic testing is necessary to identify \u2013 before age 14 days \u2013 those newborns with evidence of infantile-onset Krabbe disease who are candidates for early treatment with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).\nMANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment of a child who is symptomatic before age six months is supportive and focused on increasing the quality of life and avoiding complications. For older individuals, treatment with HSCT is individualized based on disease burden and manifestations. Prevention of primary manifestations: Consensus guidelines recommend that asymptomatic newborns identified by either prenatal/neonatal evaluation because of a positive family history of Krabbe disease or an abnormal NBS result undergo additional testing to identify those with infantile-onset Krabbe disease. Those with laboratory findings consistent with infantile-onset Krabbe disease are candidates for HSCT before age 30 days. Surveillance: Monitor symptomatic individuals with Krabbe disease for development of: hydrocephalus, swallowing difficulties and chronic microaspiration, scoliosis, hip subluxation, and osteopenia, decreased vision, and corneal ulcerations. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Atypical antipsychotics and multiple medications for seizures can cause over-sedation (affecting cognition, respiratory drive, and rate of neurologic decline). Routine childhood vaccinations can accelerate disease progression. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Couples who have had one child with molecularly confirmed infantile-onset Krabbe disease may choose prenatal molecular genetic testing in subsequent pregnancies so that newborns with biallelic GALC pathogenic variants can be promptly tested and \u2013 if appropriate -- referred for HSCT.\nGENETIC COUNSELING: Krabbe disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the GALC pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible."

A control cross between twitcher mouse/positive control human fibroblasts resulted in 14 of 21 independent hybrid lines that expressed higher than deficient levels of galactocerebrosidase activity. The lack of complementation between Krabbe disease patient and twitcher mutant mouse cells provides further evidence that the twitcher mouse is an authentic murine model for Krabbe disease and supports the hypothesis that the mutations in both species are within the structural gene for the galactocerebrosidase enzyme."

This study underscores the possible role of psychosine in the effect of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) -derived NO in the pathophysiology of this demyelinating disease. For the first time, we provide evidence of the expression of iNOS in CNS of Krabbe patient and show that the iNOS-expressing cells in the CNS were astrocytes. Psychosine potentiated the LPS-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) in primary rat astrocytes and regulated the cytokine-mediated production of NO in C6 glioma and primary rat astrocyte. Psychosine induced cytokine-mediated nuclear translocation of AP-1 and C/EBP by potentiating the expression of Fra-1 and C/EBP-delta proteins. This suggests that psychosine maintained or sustained the cytokine-primed expression of iNOS by further potentiating the nuclear translocation of AP-1 and C/EBP without modulating the cytokine-mediated transcription activity of NF-kappaB. This study hypothesizes that accumulated psychosine leads to production of cytokines and iNOS expression. The ensuing excessive production of NO and ONOO- may play a role in pathogenesis of Krabbe disease."

With the cloning of the GALC cDNA and availability of information regarding the gene organization, patients can be evaluated for their disease-causing mutations. We now report that a large deletion, together with a polymorphic C to T transition at position 502 of cDNA (counting from the A of the initiation codon), is responsible for a large number of disease-causing alleles in patients with Krabbe disease. Of 48 patients evaluated, 10 were found to be homozygous for the 502/del allele, five patients were heterozygous for this allele, 21 patients were heterozygous for the 502 mutation (presence of the deletion could not be confirmed), and one infantile patient was homozygous for the 502 mutation but at least one allele was not deleted. No patient was found to have the deletion without the 502 polymorphism. The delineation of mutations causing infantile Krabbe disease will provide new information regarding structure-function relationships in this multi-subunit enzyme and will improve the identification of patients and carriers in some families."

Often, they are portrayed as scaffolds on which many different signaling molecules can assemble their cascades. The idea of rafts as scaffolds is garnering significant attention as the consequences of LR disruption have been shown to be manifest in multiple signaling pathways. In this study, LRs in the brain of the twitcher (TWI) mouse, a bona-fide model for infant variants of human globoid cell leukodystrophy or Krabbe disease, were investigated. This mouse has deficient activity of GALC (beta-galactosylceramidase) that leads to a progressive accumulation of some galactosyl-sphingolipids in the brain. We hypothesized that the accumulation of psychosine (galactosyl-sphingosine) in the TWI CNS may result in the disruption of rafts in different cell populations such as neurons and oligodendrocytes, both cellular targets during disease. In this communication, we demonstrate that psychosine specifically accumulates in LRs in the TWI brain and sciatic nerve and in samples from brains of human Krabbe patients. It is also shown that this accumulation is accompanied by an increase in cholesterol in these domains and changes in the distribution of the LR markers flotillin-2 and caveolin-1. Finally, we show evidence that this phenomenon may provide a mechanism by which psychosine can exert its known inhibitory effect on protein kinase C. This study provides a previously undescribed biophysical aspect for the mechanism of pathogenesis in Krabbe disease."

This study underscores the mechanism of action of psychosine in the regulation of oligodendrocyte cell death via the generation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and arachidonic acid (AA) by the activation of secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2). There was a significant increase in the level of LPC, indicating a phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-dependent pathobiology, in the brains of Krabbe disease patients and those of twitcher mice, an animal model of Krabbe disease. In vitro studies of the treatment of primary oligodendrocytes and the oligodendrocyte MO3.13 cell line with psychosine also showed the generation of LPC and the release of AA in a dose- and time-dependent manner, indicating psychosine-induced activation of PLA2. Studies with various pharmacological inhibitors of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and sPLA2 and psychosine-mediated induction of sPLA2 enzymatic activity in media supernatant suggest that psychosine-induced release of AA and generation of LPC is mainly contributed by sPLA2. An inhibitor of sPLA2, 7,7-dimethyl eicosadienoic acid, completely attenuated the psychosine-mediated accumulation of LPC levels, release of AA, and generation of reactive oxygen species, and blocked oligodendroyte cell death, as evident from cell survival, DNA fragmentation, and caspase 3 activity assays. This study documents for the first time that psychosine-induced cell death is mediated via the sPLA2 signaling pathway and that inhibitors of sPLA2 may hold a therapeutic potential for protection against oligodendrocyte cell death and resulting demyelination in Krabbe disease."

We describe the molecular cloning of human GALC cDNA and its expression in COS-1 cells. Degenerate PCR primers, derived from N-terminal amino acid sequence from the 51 kDa band from human brain, were used to amplify cat testes RNA, and the resulting product was used to screen human testes and brain libraries. Two overlapping clones contained the total protein coding region, while additional clones and PCR amplification were needed to obtain the complete 3' end of the cDNA.

The final purified fractions were essentially free of other lysosomal enzyme activities. The most pure fractions showed a series of bands between 50 and 53 kDa on sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis which were determined to have identical N-terminal amino acid sequence. In addition, gel filtration of partially purified GALC after disassociation showed one peak of activity estimated to have a molecular mass near 50 kDa. GALC was also purified from human brain and human placenta using the same methods demonstrating the usefulness of this procedure in obtaining GALC from solid human tissues. In addition to the bands migrating near 50 kDa from urine, there were also bands at 80 kDa and 30 kDa in some preparations. By N-terminal sequencing and the use of antipeptide antibodies, the 80 kDa band was demonstrated to have the same N-terminal amino acids as the 50-53 kDa bands. The 30 kDa band had a unique sequence.

Clinical studies have quite clearly shown conflicting results. Basic studies, however, have shown that response to TRH is state dependent, that is, whether the patient is male or female. Clinical studies have shown that response to TRH is state dependent, that is, it depends on whether the patient has bulbar or nonbulbar signs and is male or female. Future studies must take into consideration this state dependence as a specific feature of the pharmacological action of TRH and its analogues."

They had prompt increases in serum TSH and thyroid hormone concentrations, averaging 120% for TSH, 49% for serum T4, 68% for the serum free T4 index, 49% for serum T3, and 67% for the serum free T3 index. These elevations were statistically significant for all but serum T3 and persisted for the duration of treatment (4-7 months). Mean values during treatment were near the upper limit of normal for each of these hormone measurements. After TRH withdrawal, serum TSH fell transiently below the normal range. A comparison group of four patients with ALS treated by twice weekly intrathecal bolus doses of TRH had no significant changes in serum TSH, T4, or T3. During continuous TRH treatment, the responsiveness of both TSH and PRL to a standard iv TRH stimulation test was blunted, but not abolished. Basal serum PRL was occasionally elevated in the two women during continuous TRH treatment, but was normal in the men, and serum GH was normal in all patients. In the patients receiving continuous TRH treatment, indexes of end-organ effects of thyroid hormone were inconclusive; none had a rise in serum ferritin, one of four had a rise in serum sex hormone-binding globulin, and three had increased creatinuria. These results provide direct evidence in man that chronic TRH administration can cause modest sustained increases in serum TSH and thyroid hormones, though the metabolic consequences of these changes are uncertain, and appears to raise the set-point of the pituitary-thyroid axis, i.e. the serum T4 and T3 concentrations needed for a given degree of suppression of basal TSH secretion."

Other theories include deficits in MN trophic factors, trans-synaptic degeneration, impaired ability to detoxify putative toxic agents and impaired DNA/RNA metabolism. The existence of familial forms, some of which show linkage to markers in chromosome 21, allows a genetic approach to the mechanisms of disease. Recent studies suggest that mutations in the Cu/Zn SOD gene may be important in some of the familial forms.

These central nervous system (CNS)-mediated effects provide the rationale for use of TRH and its analogs in the treatment of brain and spinal injury, and CNS disorders like schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, depression, shock and ischemia.\nAREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the patent literature and advances in the discovery and development of novel TRH analogs over the past 20 years. It provides a comprehensive overview of the development of new TRH analogs, giving emphasis to their pharmaceutical profile.\nEXPERT OPINION: The use of TRH in the treatment of various CNS disorders has been proven clinically. However, TRH itself is a poor drug candidate due to its short plasma half-life (5 min), poor biopharmaceutical properties (low intestinal and CNS permeability) and endocrine side effect. Nevertheless, researchers have come up with metabolically stable, more potent and selective TRH analogs and prodrugs. Taltirelin, one of the TRH analogs, has been approved under the trade name of Ceredist(\u00ae) in Japan for the treatment of spinocerebellar degeneration. Several other TRH analogs are in various stages of preclinical or clinical development."

The patients were given a low dose (0.5-2 mg) of TRH intravenously or intramusculary. Mild to moderate improvement was found in 9 (56%) of 16 patients. TRH has been reported to have the activating effects on the pyramidal tract, brainstem motor nuclei, and motoneuron in the spinal cord as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator.

This benefit is probably receptor-mediated and may have at least 2 components. To obtain a better understanding of the various responses to TRH of the spinal lower motor neurons (LMNs) in patients, and possibly to help guide selection of additional therapeutic agents, we utilized rat CNS (spinal-cord and brain membranes) to analyze the ability of certain molecules to inhibit specific binding of [3H]methyl TRH [( 3H]MeTRH) to the TRH receptor. We found: a) lack of high-affinity binding of the TRH-analog DN-1417 by spinal-cord and brain TRH receptor, despite its known strong TRH-like action physiologically on LMNs; b) lack of high-affinity binding of the TRH-product cyclo(His-Pro) by spinal-cord and brain TRH receptor despite its having some strong TRH-like physiologic actions on the CNS; and c) lack of any identifiable high-affinity receptor for cyclo(His-Pro) in spinal cord and brain. From these data we hypothesize that the acute transmitter-like action of DN-1417, TRH, and possibly other TRH-analogs and products on LMNs is via a non-TRH receptor, such as an amine or amino acid neurotransmitter receptor, e.g. a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor. We further postulate that the CNS TRH-receptor may modulate a trophic-like influence of TRH on LMNs."

In an attempt to identify such an abnormality at the biochemical level, we have undertaken a systematic investigation of a representative range of proteolytic enzyme types comprising the two major pathways (cytoplasmic and lysosomal) of intracellular protein degradation, in spinal cord tissue from ALS and control cases. No evidence of a generalised alteration in protein catabolizing proteolytic enzymes in spinal cord tissue from ALS cases was found. Only proline endopeptidase and pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase (both cytoplasmic proteases) showed significantly altered activity (increased by 76% and 119%, respectively) in ALS cases compared to normal controls. In addition to their generalised role in intracellular protein degradation, these two enzymes are involved in the processing of thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) in CNS tissues. The selective increase in activity of proline endopeptidase and pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase in ALS may represent an adaptation to maintain excitatory drive to surviving motor neurons by increased processing of TRH to its active metabolite."

On the other hand, chemical neuropathology allows a more precise identification of the neuronal nets or types that are involved in a disease process. This advantage is underlined by studies performed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this condition, certain modifications, such as the reductions of acetylcholinesterase, choline acetyltransferase, cholinergic muscarinic, glycine or TRH receptors, are probably a consequence of motoneuron degeneration. In contradistinction, other findings, such as specific metabolic changes of motoneurons or early disappearance of SP-containing fibers in lamina IX, might be relevant for the pathogenesis of the disease."

At sites of motor neuron injury, neuroinflammation is a prominent pathological finding and is characterized by microglial activation, astrogliosis, and infiltration of monocytes and T-cells. Both innate and adaptive immune responses actively influence disease progression in animal models and in ALS patients, and promote neuroprotection or neurotoxicity at different stages of disease. The early immune reaction to signals from injured motor neurons is to rescue and repair damaged tissue. As disease accelerates, a shift occurs from beneficial immune responses (involving M2 microglia and regulatory T-cells) to deleterious immune responses (involving M1 microglia and Th1 cells). In this review, we underscore the importance of immune-mediated mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ALS and discuss the alterations and distinct phenotypes of immune cells at the different stages of disease. The better we understand the dynamic changes that occur within the immune system over the course of disease, the better we will be able to develop effective therapeutic regimens in ALS."

T-cell deficiency increases neuronal loss, while boosting T cell levels reduces it. Here, we show that in the mutant superoxide dismutase 1 G93A (mSOD1) mouse model of ALS, the levels of natural killer T (NKT) cells increased dramatically, and T-cell distribution was altered both in lymphoid organs and in the spinal cord relative to wild-type mice. The most significant elevation of NKT cells was observed in the liver, concomitant with organ atrophy. Hepatic expression levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 decreased, while the expression of IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-1 was augmented by more than 20-fold in mSOD1 mice relative to wild-type animals. Moreover, hepatic lymphocytes of pre-symptomatic mSOD1 mice were found to secrete significantly higher levels of cytokines when stimulated with an NKT ligand, ex-vivo. Immunomodulation of NKT cells using an analogue of \u03b1-galactosyl ceramide (\u03b1-GalCer), in a specific regimen, diminished the number of these cells in the periphery, and induced recruitment of T cells into the affected spinal cord, leading to a modest but significant prolongation of life span of mSOD1 mice. These results identify NKT cells as potential players in ALS, and the liver as an additional site of major pathology in this disease, thereby emphasizing that ALS is not only a non-cell autonomous, but a non-tissue autonomous disease, as well. Moreover, the results suggest potential new therapeutic targets such as the liver for immunomodulatory intervention for modifying the disease, in addition to MN-based neuroprotection and systemic treatments aimed at reducing oxidative stress."

As neuroinflammatory processes within the CNS parenchyma are also common to other CNS pathologies, regardless of their etiology, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), these pathologies have often been compared to MS, a disease that benefits from immunosuppressive therapy. Yet, over the last decade, it became clear that autoimmunity has a bright side, and that it plays a pivotal role in CNS repair following damage. Specifically, autoimmune T cells were found to facilitate CNS healing processes, such as in the case of sterile mechanical injuries to the brain or the spinal cord, mental stress, or biochemical insults. Even more intriguingly, autoimmune T cells were found to be involved in supporting fundamental processes of brain functional integrity, such as in the maintenance of life-long brain plasticity, including spatial learning and memory, and neurogenesis. Importantly, autoimmune T cells are part of a cellular network which, to operate efficiently and safely, requires tight regulation by other immune cell populations, such as regulatory T cells, which are indispensable for maintenance of immunological self-tolerance and homeostasis. Here, we suggest that dysregulation of the balance between peripheral immune suppression, on one hand, and protective autoimmunity, on the other, is an underlying mechanism in the emergence and progression of the neuroinflammatory response associated with chronic neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging. Mitigating chronic neuroinflammation under these conditions necessitates activation, rather than suppression, of the peripheral immune response directed against self. Accordingly, we propose that fighting off acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions requires breaking peripheral immune tolerance to CNS self-antigens, in order to boost protective autoimmunity. Nevertheless, the optimal approach to fine tune such immune response must be individually explored for each condition."

Deletion of donor reactive cells has been studied using the Mls antigen system. Functional inactivation was analysed by a sequential study of the frequency of donor reactive cells. Suppressor cell activity was studied using an adoptive transfer assay. Deletion of donor reactive cells was partial and occurred largely in the spleen in both early and late stages of unresponsiveness. The frequency of donor reactive cytotoxic cells was suppressed in both spleen and lymph nodes from day +/- 13 until grafts were rejected, with the exception of a rebound period at day +/- 22. In contrast, donor reactive cells were not deleted or inactivated in the thymus. Suppressor cell activity could only be detected in mice bearing long-term grafts. These results suggest that donor reactive cytotoxic cells are functionally inactivated in the spleen and nodes in the early and late stages of unresponsiveness after intrathymic injection of antigen.

In this disease, local neuroinflammation develops along the disease course and contributes to its rapid progression. In several models of CNS pathologies, circulating immune cells were shown to display an indispensable role in the resolution of the neuroinflammatory response. The recruitment of such cells to the CNS involves activation of the choroid plexus (CP) of the brain for leukocyte trafficking, through a mechanism that requires IFN-\u03b3 signaling. Here, we found that in the mutant SOD1(G93A) (mSOD1) mouse model of ALS, the CP does not support leukocyte trafficking during disease progression, due to a local reduction in IFN-\u03b3 levels. Therapeutic immunization of mSOD1 mice with a myelin-derived peptide led to CP activation, and was followed by the accumulation of immunoregulatory cells, including IL-10-producing monocyte-derived macrophages and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, and elevation of the neurotrophic factors IGF-1 and GDNF in the diseased spinal cord parenchyma. The immunization resulted in the attenuation of disease progression and an increased life expectancy of the mSOD1 mice. Collectively, our results demonstrate that recruitment of immunoregulatory cells to the diseased spinal cord in ALS, needed for fighting off the pathology, can be enhanced by transiently boosting peripheral immunity to myelin antigens."

Several mechanisms of action, such as production of neurotrophic growth factors and interaction with neurons and glial cells, have been shown to preserve these latter from injury and stimulate growth and repair. The immune system also participates in proliferation of neural progenitor stem cells and their migration to sites of injury and this activity has been documented in various neurologic disorders including traumatic injury, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, multiple sclerosis, infection, and neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and ALS). Many therapies have been shown to stimulate the protective and regenerative aspects of the immune system in humans, such as intravenous immunoglobulins, and other experimental interventions such as vaccination, minocycline, antibodies and neural stem cells, have shown promise in animal models of ALS. Consequently, several immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies have been tried in ALS, generally with no success, in particular intravenous immunoglobulins.

In this study, we found that intrathecal MSC administration vastly increased the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the spinal cord of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mice (G93A mutant superoxide dismutase1 transgenic). Thus, we investigated the immunomodulatory effect of MSCs on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in ALS patients, focusing on regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg ; CD4(+) /CD25(high) /FoxP3(+) ) and the mRNA expression of several cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-17, IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, and TGF-\u03b2). Peripheral blood samples were obtained from nine healthy controls (HC) and sixteen patients who were diagnosed with definite or probable ALS. Isolated PBMCs from the blood samples of all subjects were co-cultured with MSCs for 24 or 72\u00a0h. Based on a fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, we found that co-culture with MSCs increased the Treg /total T-lymphocyte ratio in the PBMCs from both groups according to the co-culture duration. Co-culture of PBMCs with MSCs for 24\u00a0h led to elevated mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 in the PBMCs from both groups. However, after co-culturing for 72\u00a0h, although the IFN-\u03b3 mRNA level had returned to the basal level in co-cultured HC PBMCs, the IFN-\u03b3 mRNA level in co-cultured ALS PBMCs remained elevated. Additionally, the levels of IL-4 and TGF-\u03b2 were markedly elevated, along with Gata3 mRNA, a Th2 transcription factor mRNA, in both HC and ALS PBMCs co-cultured for 72\u00a0h. The elevated expression of these cytokines in the co-culture supernatant was confirmed via ELISA. Furthermore, we found that the increased mRNA level of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the co-cultured MSCs was correlated with the increase in Treg induction. These findings of Treg induction and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine expression in co-cultured ALS PBMCs provide indirect evidence that MSCs may play a role in the immunomodulation of inflammatory responses when MSC therapy is targeted to ALS patients. We propose the following mechanism for the effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) administered intrathecally in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): MSCs increase infiltration of peripheral immune cells into CNS and skew the infiltrated immune cells toward regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg ) and Th2 lymphocytes. Treg and Th2 secret anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-\u03b2. A series of immunomodulatory mechanism provides a new strategy for ALS treatment."

The predominant genetic defects in PW are 15q11-13 deletions of paternal origin and maternal chromosome 15 uniparental disomy. In contrast, maternal deletions and paternal chromosome 15 uniparental disomy are associated with a different neurogenetic disorder, the AS. In both disorders, these mutations are associated with parent-of-origin specific methylation at several 15q11-13 loci. We studied 5 patients suspect of PWS and 4 patients suspect of AS who were referred to the Medical Genetics Unit at the University Hospital of Medical School from Ribeir\u00e3o Preto. Our objective was to establish the correct clinical and etiological diagnosis in these cases. We used conventional cytogenetics, methylation analysis with the probe KB17 (CpG island of the SNRPN gene) by Southern blotting after digestion with the Xba I and Not I restriction enzymes. We studied in patients and their parents the segregation of the (CA)*** repeats polymorphisms by PCR, using the primers 196 and IR4-3R. All the patients had normal conventional cytogenetical analysis. We confirmed 3 cases of PWS: one by de novo deletion, one by maternal chromosome 15 uniparental disomy and one case with no defined cause determined by the used primers. We confirmed 2 cases of AS, caused by de novo deletion at the 15q11-13 region, and one case with normal molecular analysis but with strong clinical characteristics."

Abnormalities in imprinted inheritance occur in several genetic diseases and cancer, and are exemplified by the diverse genetic defects involving chromosome 15q11-q13 in Prader-Willi (PWS) and Angelman (AS) syndromes. PWS involves loss of function of multiple paternally expressed genes, while mutations in a single gene, UBE3A, which is subject to spatially restricted imprinting, occur in some AS patients. Identification of mutations in the imprinting process in PWS and AS has led to a definition of an imprinting center (IC), involving the promoter (in PWS) or an alternative transcript of the SNRPN gene (in AS). The IC regulates initiation of imprint switching for all genes in a 2 Mb imprinted domain during gametogenesis. Imprinting mutations define a novel mechanism of genetic disease because they have no direct effect in the affected patient but, rather, it is the parental germline effect of an IC mutation that leads to disease in the offspring."

The purpose of this study was to show the molecular genetic defects and genomic imprinting basis in Chinese PWS patients and to evaluate the clinical applications of a differential diagnostic test for PWS.\nMETHODS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and methylation-specific PCR (MSPCR) techniques were applied for 4 clinically suspected PWS patients. Using three probes, including SNRPN probe for identification of the critical locus in PWS region, D15Z1 and PML control probes for identification of the 15p arm and 15q arm, the authors detected the deletions 15q in PWS. MSPCR was based on sodium bisulfite treatment of DNA and PCR primers specific for the maternal and paternal allele.\nRESULTS: When hybridized with mixed probes, it was found in 2 patients that the central specific signal was absent, but both the flanking control signals were retained, indicating SNRPN gene deletion of chromosome 15q11-13. Bisulfite-modified DNA from all PWS children amplified with methylated allele-specific primer pair showed only maternal 131bp PCR product, indicating the maternal uniparental disomy (UPD15).\nCONCLUSION: Genomic imprinting plays an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of PWS that caused by paternal microdeletions of 15q11-q13 or maternal UPD of chromosome 15. The basic defect seemed to be an absence of function of PWS genes that are normally expressed only from the paternal chromosome 15. MSPCR is a rapid and simple PCR-based assay compared with other cyto-molecular tests and its results were consistent with the clinical diagnosis of PWS, so it seems to be a reliable diagnostic method for PWS patients who show abnormal methylation at SNRPN. The genetic differential tests for PWS are important in determining familial recurrence risk."

The prevalence of Prader-Willi syndrome is estimated to be one in 10,000 to 25,000. However, descriptions of the oral and dental phenotype are rare.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We describe the clinical presentation and periodontal findings in a 20-year-old Japanese man with previously diagnosed Prader-Willi syndrome. Clinical and radiographic findings confirmed the diagnosis of periodontitis. The most striking oral findings were anterior open bite, and crowding and attrition of the lower first molars. Periodontal treatment consisted of tooth-brushing instruction and scaling. Home care involved recommended use of adjunctive chlorhexidine gel for tooth brushing twice a week and chlorhexidine mouthwash twice daily. Gingival swelling improved, but further treatment will be required and our patient's oral hygiene remains poor. The present treatment of tooth-brushing instruction and scaling every three weeks therefore only represents a temporary solution.\nCONCLUSIONS: Rather than being a direct result of genetic defects, periodontal diseases in Prader-Willi syndrome may largely result from a loss of cuspid guidance leading to traumatic occlusion, which in turn leads to the development of periodontal diseases and dental plaque because of poor oral hygiene. These could be avoided by early interventions to improve occlusion and regular follow-up to monitor oral hygiene. This report emphasizes the importance of long-term follow-up of oral health care by dental practitioners, especially pediatric dentists, to prevent periodontal disease and dental caries in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, who appear to have problems maintaining their own oral health."

Most paternal PWS deletions are bracketed by recurrent breakpoints BP1 or BP2 and BP3. Atypical deletions are very rare. In the present work, we describe the molecular analysis of two patients with atypical deletions using microsatellite analysis, methylation-specific MLPA, and microarray CGH. A deletion of about 2 Mb in Patient 1 started at BP2 and ended in the middle of the typically deleted region within the UBE3A gene. The deletion in Patient 2 started 1.3 Mb distal from BP2 within the C15ORF2 gene, extended over 9.5 Mb, and ended within the AVEN gene in proximal 15q14. In Patient 1 both deletion breakpoints involved repetitive regions, which precluded cloning of the junction and pointed to non-allelic homologous recombination as a possible mechanism of this rearrangement. The breakpoints in Patient 2 were sequenced, and their structure suggested non-homologous end joining as the most likely cause of this deletion. The phenotype of both patients did not depart significantly from the typical clinical picture of PWS, although some symptoms in Patient 2 were also reminiscent of the phenotype of individuals with the recently described 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome. Our findings support previous observations of relatively mild phenotypic effects resulting from deletions that extend distally from the PWS region and observations of the modest effects of different types of genetic defects on the spectrum and severity of symptoms in PWS."

It is characterized by severe neonatal hypotonia and feeding problems, childhood-onset hyperphagia and obesity, short stature, facial dysmorphy, hypogonadism, learning and behavioural difficulties, and dental abnormalities.\nAIM: To describe the oro-dental phenotypic spectrum of patients with PWS.\nDESIGN: Fifteen PWS patients (3-35 years of age) being followed at the Centre for Human Genetics of the University Hospital of Leuven were examined at the dental clinic of the same institution. Medical information collected included age at diagnosis, body mass index (BMI) and level of cognitive functioning. Oral, clinical and radiological evaluations were performed. Caries experience (cavitation level), dental erosion and salivary flow rates were assessed.\nRESULTS: The 15 patients had dmft/DMFT scores ranging from 0 to 28, while nine were cavity-free. Those with severe caries experience also presented advanced dental erosion. BMI ranged from 16 to 42.6. There was no association between BMI and caries experience or erosive tooth wear. The PWS patients in our survey presented with a more favourable oral health status than those in previous studies. This might be due to early diet management or better oral hygiene during childhood or both."

In contrast, maternal deletions and paternal chromosome 15 UPD are associated with a different neurogenetic disorder, Angelman syndrome (AS). In both disorders, these mutations are associated with parent-of-origin specific methylation at several 15q11-q13 loci. The critical PWS region has been narrowed to a approximately 320-kb region between D15S63 and D15S174, encoding several imprinted transcripts, including PAR5, IPW, PAR1 (refs 7,8) and SNRPN, which has so far been considered a strong candidate for the PWS gene. A few PWS-associated microdeletions involving a putative imprinting centre (IC) proximal to SNRPN have also been observed. We have mapped the breakpoint of a balanced translocation (9;15)pat associated with most of the PWS features between SNRPN and IPWIPAR1. Methylation and expression studies indicate that the paternal SNRPN allele is unaffected by the translocation, while IPW and PAR1 are unexpressed. This focuses the attention on genes distal to the breakpoint as the main candidate for PWS genes, and is consistent with a cis action of the putative IC, and suggests that further studies of translocational disruption of the imprinted region may establish genotype-phenotype relationships in this presumptive contiguous gene syndrome."

Laboratory diagnosis is currently performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), DNA polymorphism (microsatellite) analysis, or DNA methylation analysis at locus PW71 (D15S63). We examined another parent-of-origin-specific DNA methylation assay at exon alpha of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated polypeptide N gene (SNRPN) in patients referred with clinical suspicion of PWS or Angelman syndrome (AS). These included 30 PWS and 17 AS patients with known deletion or uniparental disomy status, and a larger cohort of patients (n = 512) suspected of PWS who had been analyzed previously for their methylation status at the PW71 locus. Results of SNRPN methylation were consistent with known deletion or uniparental disomy (UPD) status as determined by other molecular methods in all 47 cases of PWS and AS. In the larger cohort of possible PWS patients, SNRPN results were consistent with clinical diagnosis by examination and with PW71 methylation results in all cases. These data provide support for the use of SNRPN methylation as a diagnostic method. Because methylation analysis can detect all three major classes of genetic defects associated with PWS (deletion, UPD, or imprinting mutations), methylation analysis with either PW71 or SNRPN is an efficient primary screening test to rule out a diagnosis of PWS. Only patients with an abnormal methylation result require further diagnostic investigation by FISH or DNA polymorphism analysis to distinguish among the three classes for accurate genetic counseling and recurrence-risk assessment."

Several explanations for this failure to detect mutations have been proposed, including genetic heterogeneity, failure of allele expression, and technical difficulties. Genetic heterogeneity has been confirmed as an explanation for such failure, since causative mutations have been identified in the COL5A1, COL5A2, and tenascin X genes and since they have been inferred in the COL1A2 gene. Nonetheless, in the majority of families with autosomal dominant inheritance of EDS, there appears to be linkage to loci that contain the COL5A1 or COL5A2 genes. To determine whether allele-product instability could explain failure to identify some mutations, we analyzed polymorphic variants in the COL5A1 gene in 16 individuals, and we examined mRNA for the expression of both alleles and for alterations in splicing. We found a splice-site mutation in a single individual, and we determined that, in six individuals, the mRNA from one COL5A1 allele either was not expressed or was very unstable. We identified small insertions or deletions in five of these cell strains, but we could not identify the mutation in the sixth individual. Thus, although as many as one-half of the mutations that give rise to EDS types I and II are likely to lie in the COL5A1 gene, a significant portion of them result in very low levels of mRNA from the mutant allele, as a consequence of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay."

Since exon 65 encodes 78 residues of the carboxyl propeptide, the expected result of this mutation is reduced efficiency in incorporating mutant pro alpha 1(V) chains into type V collagen molecules and reduced type V collagen synthesis. These studies indicate that heterozygous mutations in COL5A1 can result in EDS type I.

All products were in frame. Pro-alpha1(V) chains with abnormal N-propeptides were secreted and were incorporated into extracellular matrix, and the mutation resulted in dramatic alterations in collagen fibril structure. The two-exon skip occurred in transcripts in which intron 5 was removed rapidly relative to introns 4 and 6, leaving a large (270 nt) composite exon that can be skipped in its entirety. The transcripts in which only exon 5 was skipped were derived from those in which intron 6 was removed prior to intron 5. The use of cryptic acceptor sites in exon 5 occurred in transcripts in which intron 4 was removed subsequent to introns 5 and 6.

It is currently estimated that approximately 50% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harbor mutations in the COL5A1 and the COL5A2 gene, encoding the \u03b11 and the \u03b12-chain of type V collagen, respectively. However, because no prospective molecular studies of COL5A1 and COL5A2 have been performed in a clinically well-defined patient group, this number may underestimate the real proportion of patients with classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harboring a mutation in one of these genes. In the majority of patients with molecularly characterized classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the disease is caused by a mutation leading to a nonfunctional COL5A1 allele and resulting in haploinsufficiency of type V collagen. A smaller proportion of patients harbor a structural mutation in COL5A1 or COL5A2, causing the production of a functionally defective type V collagen protein. Most mutations identified so far result in a reduced amount of type V collagen in the connective tissues available for collagen fibrillogenesis. Inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variability is observed, but no genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed. No treatment for the underlying defect is presently available for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. However, a series of preventive guidelines are applicable."

            "answer": [
                "Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, variable expressivity, and incomplete penetrance. Two thirds of TSC cases result from sporadic genetic mutations, not inheritance, but their offspring may inherit it from them. Current genetic tests have difficulty locating the mutation in approximately 20% of individuals diagnosed with the disease. So far it has been mapped to two genetic loci, TSC1 and TSC2.\nTSC1 encodes for the protein hamartin, is located on chromosome 9 q34 and was discovered in 1997. TSC2 encodes for the protein Tuberin, is located on chromosome 16 p13.3 and was discovered in 1993. TSC2 is contiguous with PKD1, the gene involved in one form of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Gross deletions affecting both genes may account for the 2% of individuals with TSC who also develop PKD in childhood. TSC2 has been associated with a more severe form of TSC. However, the difference is subtle and cannot be used to identify the mutation clinically. Estimates of the proportion of TSC caused by TSC2 range from 55% to 80-90%.",
                "Yes, Tuberous Sclerosis is a genetic disease, caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene."

Charts were reviewed for a history of infantile spasms (IS), seizure other than IS, refractory epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), anticonvulsant medication use, ages of seizure onset, last seizure, last clinic visit, clinical seizure phenotype(s), cognitive impairment, and genetic mutation.\nRESULTS: Two hundred ninety-one patients were included. Among these patients, 37.8% had a history of IS; 85.2% had a history of seizure; 54.1% developed multiple seizure types, not including IS; 63.2% had seizure onset in the first year of life; and 12.1% of adults without a seizure history developed epilepsy. Of epilepsy patients, 62.5% developed refractory epilepsy and 33.5% achieved epilepsy remission; 37.5% of these patients achieved medication freedom. IS was a risk factor for refractory epilepsy (p<0.0001) and LGS (p<0.0001). History of seizure, IS, age at seizure onset, and refractory epilepsy each correlated with poor cognitive outcome (p<0.0001). Epilepsy remission correlated with better cognitive outcome (p<0.0001). TSC2 was a risk factor for IS and epilepsy; patients without an identified mutation were more likely to achieve remission.\nCONCLUSION: Most patients with TSC develop epilepsy and most develop multiple seizure types. Onset typically occurs in the first year of life; however, adults remain at risk. Although refractory epilepsy is common, many patients achieve seizure control. Many features of seizure history are predictive of cognitive and epilepsy outcome."

Variations in the distribution, number, size, and location of lesions cause the clinical syndrome to vary even between relatives. About 85% of children and adolescents with TSC have CNS complications, including epilepsy, cognitive impairment, challenging behavioral problems, and autism-like symptoms. Epilepsy generally begins during the first year of life, with focal seizures and spasms.

Tuberous Sclerosis Complex is genetically determined with an autosomal dominant inheritance and is caused by inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. TSC1/2 genes play a fundamental role in the regulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway, inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through activation of the GTPase activity of Rheb. Mutations in TSC1/2 genes impair the inhibitory function of the hamartin/tuberin complex, leading to phosphorylation of the downstream effectors of mTOR, p70 S6 kinase (S6K), ribosomal protein S6 and the elongation factor binding protein 4E-BP1, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth and tumourigenesis.Despite recent promising genetic, diagnostic, and therapeutic advances in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, continuing research in all aspects of this complex disease will be pivotal to decrease its associated morbidity and mortality.

It is controversial as to whether these lesion represent a forme fruste of tuberous sclerosis or a distinct entity. The recently reported loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the regions of the TSC1 or TSC2 locus in hamartomas obtained from different organs of patients with established tuberous sclerosis, including cortical tubers, stimulated us to examine epilepsy-associated tuberous sclerosis-like glioneuronal malformations with respect to LOH at the TSC1 and TSC2 loci of chromosomes 9q34 and 16p 13.3, respectively. The analysis was carried out on DNA derived from paraffin-embedded brain tissues of 11 patients. For 5 patients, peripheral blood leukocytes were also available for DNA extraction. We performed microsatellite analysis with five markers on chromosome 9 and four markers on chromosome 16. In addition, polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was performed using a polymorphic EcoRV restriction site in exon 40 of the TSC2 gene. No LOH was identified in any of the cases. These findings do not support a relationship between the epilepsy-associated glioneuronal lesions and tuberous sclerosis. However, tuberous sclerosis is genetically heterogeneous and microsatellite and RFLP analysis cannot exclude small deletions or point mutations. Thus, given the histopathological similarity of glioneuronal malformations in epilepsy patients to cortical tubers, further molecular genetic studies will be needed as our understanding of the molecular basis of tuberous sclerosis increases to completely clarify the relationship of these lesions to tuberous sclerosis."

Despite much progress in defining abnormal signaling pathways including the contribution of increased mTORC1 signaling, specific abnormalities that underlie the severe neurologic features in TSC remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that epilepsy and autism in TSC result from abnormalities of \u03b3-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) interneurons. To test this hypothesis, we generated conditional knockout mice with selective deletion of the Tsc1 gene in GABAergic interneuron progenitor cells. These interneuron-specific Tsc1 conditional knockout (CKO) mice have impaired growth and decreased survival. Cortical and hippocampal GABAergic interneurons of CKO mice are enlarged and show increased mTORC1 signaling. Total numbers of GABAergic cells are reduced in the cortex with differential reduction of specific GABAergic subtypes. Ectopic clusters of cells with increased mTORC1 signaling are also seen suggesting impaired interneuron migration. The functional consequences of these cellular changes are evident in the decreased seizure threshold on exposure to the proconvulsant flurothyl. These findings support an important role for the Tsc1 gene during GABAergic interneuron development, function, and possibly migration."

It is characterized by skin and adnexal lesions and central and peripheral nervous system tumors, with neurological and psychiatric findings. It may affect the heart, kidneys, eyes, face, bones, lungs, stomach and dentition.\nCASE REPORT: We present the case of a 66-year-old man with dermatological signs that included hypopigmented maculae, confetti-like lesions, shagreen plaque, angiofibromas on nasolabial folds, neck and back, nail dystrophy and periungual fibromas on fingers and toes. An electroencephalogram produced normal results, but magnetic resonance imaging showed a nodular image measuring 1.2 x 1.0 cm close to the Monro foramen, which was similar to cerebral parenchyma and compatible with a subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma. A conservative approach was taken, through control imaging examinations on the lesion for seven years, with absence of any expansive process or neurological symptoms. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a solid, heterogenic and echogenic mass with a calcified focus, measuring 4.6 x 3.4 cm, in the rightkidney, compatible with angiomyolipoma. The patient was treated by means of complete nephrectomy because of malignant areas seen on histopathological examination and died one month after the procedure. This case report illustrates the importance of oral clinical findings such as dental enamel pits and angiofibromas in making an early diagnosis of TSC, with subsequent screening examinations, treatment and genetic counseling."

Heterozygous mutations in either of two genes, TSC1 (hamartin) or TSC2 (tuberin), are responsible for most cases. Hamartin and tuberin form a heterodimer that functions as a major cellular inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase. Genotype-phenotype studies suggest that TSC2 mutations are associated with a more severe neurologic phenotype, although the biologic basis for the difference between TSC1- and TSC2-based disease is unclear. Here we performed a study to compare and contrast the brain phenotypes of Tsc1 and Tsc2 single and double mutants. Using Tsc1 and Tsc2 floxed alleles and a radial glial transgenic Cre driver (FVB-Tg(GFAP-cre)25Mes/J), we deleted Tsc1 and/or Tsc2 in radial glial progenitor cells. Single and double mutants had remarkably similar phenotypes: early postnatal mortality, brain overgrowth, laminar disruption, astrogliosis, a paucity of oligodendroglia, and myelination defects. Double Tsc1/Tsc2 mutants died earlier than single mutants, and single mutants showed differences in the location of heterotopias and the organization of the hippocampal stratum pyramidale. The differences were not due to differential mTORC1 activation or feedback inhibition on Akt. These data provide further genetic evidence for individual hamartin and tuberin functions that may explain some of the genotype-phenotype differences seen in the human disease."

Heightened signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is involved in TSC pathology, however it remains unclear how other signaling pathways are perturbed and contribute to disease symptoms. Reduced long-term depression (LTD) was recently reported in TSC mutant mice. We find that although reduced LTD is a feature of the juvenile mutant hippocampus, heightened expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 and constitutively activated Erk signaling in the adult hippocampus drives wild-type levels of LTD. Increased mGluR5 and Erk results in a novel mTOR-independent LTD in CA1 hippocampus of adult mice, and contributes to the development of epileptiform bursting activity in the TSC2(+/-) CA3 region of the hippocampus. Inhibition of mGluR5 or Erk signaling restores appropriate mTOR-dependence to LTD, and significantly reduces epileptiform bursting in TSC2(+/-) hippocampal slices. We also report that adult TSC2(+/-) mice exhibit a subtle perseverative behavioral phenotype that is eliminated by mGluR5 antagonism. These findings highlight the potential of modulating the mGluR5-Erk pathway in a developmental stage-specific manner to treat TSC."

These malformations typically exhibit neuronal as well as glial cell abnormalities and likely underlie much of the neurological morbidity seen in TSC. Tuber pathogenesis remains poorly understood though upregulation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway in TSC has been consistently demonstrated. Here we address abnormal brain development in TSC by inactivating the mouse Tsc1 gene in embryonic neural progenitor cells. This strategy permits evaluation of the role of the Tsc1 gene in both neuronal as well as glial cell lineages. Tsc1(Emx1-Cre) conditional knockout (CKO) animals die by 25 days of life. Their brains have increased size and contain prominent large cells within the cerebral cortex that have greatly increased mTORC1 signaling and decreased mTORC2 signaling. Severe defects of cortical lamination, enlarged dysmorphic astrocytes and decreased myelination were also found. Tsc1(Emx1-Cre) CKO mice were then treated with rapamycin to see if the premature death and brain abnormalities can be rescued. Postnatal rapamycin treatment completely prevented premature death and largely reversed the glia pathology but not abnormal neuronal lamination. These findings support a model that loss of function of the TSC genes in embryonic neural progenitor cells causes cortical malformations in patients with TSC. The dramatic effect of rapamycin suggests that even with extensive multi-lineage abnormalities, a postnatal therapeutic window may exist for patients with TSC."

TSC has been recognized for many years as an important cause of severe neurological disease with patients suffering from epilepsy, developmental delay, autism, and psychiatric problems. During the last year, there have been enormous advances in basic and translational research pertaining to TSC.\nRECENT FINDINGS: In this review, I discuss the basic science findings that position the TSC1 and TSC2 genes as critical regulators of the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase within mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. In addition, I will discuss the development of new animal models, translational data, and recent clinical trials using mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 inhibitors such as rapamycin.\nSUMMARY: The past few years have seen spectacular advances that have energized TSC-related research and challenged existing symptomatic treatments. Although it remains to be seen whether use of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 inhibitors will revolutionize the care of patients with TSC, the application of basic and translational research towards a specific clinical disorder emphasizes the potential and promise of molecular medicine."

Epilepsy and autism are two of the more prevalent neurological complications and are usually severe. TSC is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 (encodes hamartin) or the TSC2 (encodes tuberin) genes with TSC2 mutations being associated with worse outcomes. Tuberin contains a highly conserved GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain that indirectly inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). mTORC1 dysregulation is currently thought to cause much of the pathogenesis in TSC but mTORC1-independent mechanisms may also contribute. We generated a novel conditional allele of Tsc2 by flanking exons 36 and 37 with loxP sites. Mice homozygous for this knock-in Tsc2 allele are viable and fertile with normal appearing growth and development. Exposure to Cre recombinase then creates an in-frame deletion involving critical residues of the GAP domain. Homozygous conditional mutant mice generated using Emx1(Cre) have increased cortical mTORC1 signaling, severe developmental brain anomalies, seizures, and die within 3 weeks. We found that the normal levels of the mutant Tsc2 mRNA, though GAP-deficient tuberin protein, appear unstable and rapidly degraded. This novel animal model will allow further study of tuberin function including the requirement of the GAP domain for protein stability."

We have reported previously that phosphorylation of serine 1210 (Ser(1210)) in TSC2 is essential for 14-3-3 binding. Here we show that serum and anisomycin enhance the interaction between TSC2 and 14-3-3 by stimulating phosphorylation of Ser(1210). Activation of p38 MAP kinase (p38) is essential for the stimulating effect of serum and anisomycin although p38 is not directly responsible for the phosphorylation of Ser(1210) in TSC2. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the p38-activated kinase MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) is directly responsible for the phosphorylation of Ser(1210). Our data show that anisomycin stimulates phosphorylation of Ser(1210) of TSC2 via the p38-MK2 kinase cascade. Phosphorylation of TSC2 by MK2 creates a 14-3-3 binding site and thus regulates the cellular function of the TSC2 tumor suppressor protein."

Rheb and TSC2 comprise a unique pair of GTPase and GAP, because Rheb has high basal GTP levels and TSC2 does not have the catalytic arginine finger found in Ras-GAP. To investigate the function of TSC2 and Rheb in mTOR signaling, we analyzed the TSC2-stimulated Rheb GTPase activity. We found that Arg15, a residue equivalent to Gly12 in Ras, is important for Rheb to function as a substrate for TSC2 GAP. In addition, we identified asparagine residues essential for TSC2 GAP activity. We demonstrated a novel catalytic mechanism of the TSC2 GAP and Rheb that TSC2 uses a catalytic \"asparagine thumb\" instead of the arginine finger found in Ras-GAP. Furthermore, we discovered that farnesylation and membrane localization of Rheb is not essential for Rheb to stimulate S6 kinase (S6K) phosphorylation. Analysis of TSC1 binding defective mutants of TSC2 shows that TSC1 is not required for the TSC2 GAP activity but may function as a regulatory component in the TSC1/TSC2 complex.

The disease is caused by mutational inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) or TSC2.

The mice show enlargement of alveolar airspaces that is associated with progressive growth of TSC2-null lesions in the lung, up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade extracellular matrix, and destruction of elastic fibers. TSC2-null lesions and alveolar destruction were differentially inhibited by the macrolide antibiotic rapamycin (which inhibits TSC2-null lesion growth by a cytostatic mechanism) and a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, simvastatin (which inhibits growth of TSC2-null lesions by a predominantly proapoptotic mechanism).

The TSC1 and TSC2 gene products form a functional complex and inhibit phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP1. These functions of TSC1/TSC2 are likely mediated by mTOR. Here we report that TSC2 is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) toward Rheb, a Ras family GTPase. Rheb stimulates phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP1. This function of Rheb is blocked by rapamycin and dominant-negative mTOR. Rheb stimulates the phosphorylation of mTOR and plays an essential role in regulation of S6K and 4EBP1 in response to nutrients and cellular energy status. Our data demonstrate that Rheb acts downstream of TSC1/TSC2 and upstream of mTOR to regulate cell growth."

The hallmark pathological finding in TSC is the cerebral cortical tuber and its unique constituent, giant cells. However, an animal model that replicates giant cells has not yet been described. Here, we report that mosaic induction of Tsc1 loss in neural progenitor cells in Tsc1(cc) Nestin-rtTA(+) TetOp-cre(+) embryos by doxycycline leads to multiple neurological symptoms, including severe epilepsy and premature death. Strikingly, Tsc1-null neural progenitor cells develop into highly enlarged giant cells with enlarged vacuoles. We found that the vacuolated giant cells had multiple signs of organelle dysfunction, including markedly increased mitochondria, aberrant lysosomes, and elevated cellular stress. We found similar vacuolated giant cells in human tuber specimens. Postnatal rapamycin treatment completely reversed these phenotypes and rescued the mutants from epilepsy and premature death, despite prenatal onset of Tsc1 loss and mTOR complex 1 activation in the developing brain. This TSC brain model provides insights into the pathogenesis and organelle dysfunction of giant cells, as well as epilepsy control in patients with TSC."

For this reason the identification of the disease causing mutation is mandatory for accurate counseling, yet current mutation detection methods such as single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) are labor intensive with limited detection efficiency. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) is a high-throughput, semi-automated mutation detection system with a reported mutation detection rate close to 100% for PCR fragments of up to 800 bp. We used a recently described DHPLC assay allowing the efficient detection of mutations in TSC1 to analyze the DNA extracted from a chorion villus sample in order to perform a prenatal diagnosis for TSC. The fetus was found not to have inherited the deleterious mutation and the DHPLC diagnosis was confirmed by haplotype analysis.

Involvement of the brain can result in persistent seizures and mental retardation; skin involvement includes facial angiofibromas, subungual fibromas, hypomelanotic macules, forehead fibrous plaques, and Shagreen's patches. Approximately 60% of TS occurs as apparent sporadic cases. In families, it has autosomal dominant inheritance with high penetrance (approximately 95%), with careful clinical and radiologic evaluation. Genetic linkage analysis indicates that about half of all TS families show linkage to chromosome 9q34, and about half to chromosome 16p13. There are no distinguishing features in the two groups of families showing linkage to the two genomic regions, nor strong evidence for a third causative gene. Positional cloning efforts for both chromosomal regions have limited the region containing the gene to about 1 to 2 million bases.\nCONCLUSIONS: Identification of the two TS genes should illuminate the pathogenesis of TS and provide opportunities for genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis, and therapeutic intervention."

Here we present an overview of our functional studies on 45 TSC1 and 107 TSC2 variants. Using a standardized protocol we classified 16 TSC1 variants and 70 TSC2 variants as pathogenic.

In this situation a modest collection of families is unlikely to be sufficient for successful localisation of one or more disease genes. Recently, eight research groups working on tuberous sclerosis (TSC) brought together linkage data pertaining to the candidate chromosomes 9, 11, and 12 for a large group of families. In a series of simulation studies we determined the probability of detecting linkage and linkage heterogeneity in this set of families. On average TSC families are very small; in most cases there are fewer than two informative meioses. The size distribution of chromosome 9 linked families was similar to that of non-linked families. This indicates that a dramatic difference in the clinical severity of major genetic forms of TSC is unlikely. The results of our simulation studies show that this set of families can generate highly significant evidence for linkage and heterogeneity. When two TSC genes are equally common, the strongest evidence for linkage and heterogeneity could be obtained using a method based on the incorporation of multiple candidate regions in a single analysis, with an average lod score of 24.27."

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disease that presents with epilepsy, autism, and intellectual disability. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of TSC pathogenesis and signaling pathways that may be modulated to treat the neurological symptoms.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Accumulating evidence suggests that TSC patients have nontuber abnormalities that contribute to the development of the neurological phenotype- in particular, disorganization of axon tracts and deficient myelination. TSC mouse models have failed to replicate the human neuropathology entirely, but have shed light on the cellular abnormalities and the neurobehavioral phenotypes. Most importantly, cell culture and animal models have identified the mTORC1 pathway as a therapeutic target in this disease.\nSUMMARY: Preclinical data strongly suggest that TSC is a disease of abnormal neuronal connectivity. The high incidence of neurodevelopmental deficits, early detection of the disease in very young ages, and availability of mTORC1 inhibitors make TSC a model for other Mendelian disorders of neurocognition and an avenue for the mechanism-based treatment trials of neurodevelopmental disorders."

Anthropometric measurements and musculoskeletal abnormalities were determined in a standardized fashion: pectus and scoliosis were assessed through radiography and angulation (\u00e2) of the scoliosis curve using the Cobb method; arachnodactyly was assessed through the thumb sign and Walker-Murdoch test and dolichostenomelia was assessed by arm span in relation to height. Patients also responded to a questionnaire addressing participation in physical therapy.\nRESULTS: In comparison to values estimated for the Brazilian population, mass and height were greater among the patients with MS (females: p=0.001 e p<0.0005 e males p=0.019 e p=0.0001, respectively). The following musculoskeletal abnormalities were found: pectus in 3 patients (11%), pectus and scoliosis in 19 (73%), dolichostenomelia in 11 (42%) and arachnodactyly in 21 (80%). Eleven patients (42%) with MS had previously undergone physical therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS exhibit altered musculoskeleto and anthropometry and have infrequent physical therapy treatment."

A number of gene abnormalities responsible for Tay-Sachs disease have already been identified and the correlation between the beta-hexosaminidase alpha gene abnormality and the clinical phenotype has been explained in many cases. In the severest phenotype of Tay-Sachs disease (infantile form), mRNA of beta-hexosaminidase alpha subunit is not produced or is unstable such as in French Canadian patients or in Jewish patients with infantile Tay-Sachs disease, or the polypeptide does not have any catalytic activities because of the alteration of glycosylation such as the mutation of Glu482-to-Lys found in a Italian patient or the altered structure of polypeptide. The mutation identified in a large majority of the Japanese infantile Tay-Sachs disease patients, which is a G-to-T substitution at 3'-end of intron 5, generates a short mRNA with complete skipping of exon 6 and a polypeptide lacking 34 amino acids is generated but catalytically inactive.

In the present study we have studied 17 Argentinean families affected by TSD, including 20 patients with the acute infantile form and 3 with the sub-acute form. Overall, we identified 14 different mutations accounting for 100% of the studied alleles. Eight mutations were novel: 5 were single base changes leading to drastic residue changes or truncated proteins, 2 were small deletions and one was an intronic mutation that may cause a splicing defect. Although the spectrum of mutations was highly heterogeneous, a high frequency of the c.459+5G>A mutation, previously described in different populations was found among the studied cohort. Haplotype analysis suggested that in these families the c.459+5G>A mutation might have arisen by a single mutational event."

Two mutations are novel, c.814G>A (p.Gly272Arg) and c.1305C>T (p.=), located in exon 8 and in exon 11, respectively. The third mutation, c.1195A>G (p.Asn399Asp) in exon 11, has been previously characterized as a common polymorphism in African-Americans. Hex A activity measured in TSD Glial cells, transfected with HEXA cDNA constructs bearing these mutations, was unaltered from the activity level measured in normal HEXA cDNA. Analysis of RT-PCR products revealed three aberrant transcripts in the patient, one where exon 8 was absent, one where exon 11 was absent and a third lacking both exons 10 and 11. All three novel transcripts contain frameshifts resulting in premature termination codons (PTCs). Transfection of mini-gene constructs carrying the c.814G>A and c.1305C>T mutations proved that the two mutations result in exon skipping. mRNAs that harbor a PTC are detected and degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway to prevent synthesis of abnormal proteins. However, although NMD is functional in the patient's fibroblasts, aberrant transcripts are still present. We suggest that the level of correctly spliced transcripts as well as the efficiency in which NMD degrade the PTC-containing transcripts, apparently plays an important role in the phenotype severity of the unique patient and thus should be considered as a potential target for drug therapy."

Ashkenazi Jewish patients with classic Tay-Sachs disease have appeared to be clinically and biochemically identical, and the usual assumption has been that they harbor the same alpha-chain mutation. In this study I have isolated the alpha-chain gene from an Ashkenazi Jewish patient, GM2968, with classic Tay-Sachs disease and compared its nucleotide sequences with that of the normal alpha-chain gene in the promoter region, exon and splice junction regions, and polyadenylylation signal area. Only one difference was observed between these sequences: at the 5' boundary of intron 12, a guanosine in the conserved splice junction dinucleotide sequence G-T had been altered to a cytidine. The alteration is presumed to be functionally significant and to result in aberrant mRNA splicing. Utilizing the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the region encompassing the mutation, I developed an assay to screen patients and heterozygote carriers for this mutation. Surprisingly, in each of two Ashkenazi patients, only one alpha-chain allele harbored the splice junction mutation. Only one parent of each of these patients was positive for the defect. Another Ashkenazi patient did not bear this mutation at all nor did either of the subject's parents. In addition, 30% of obligate heterozygotes tested carried the splice junction mutation, whereas 20 Ashkenazi Jews designated noncarriers by enzymatic assay were negative for this alteration. The data are consistent with the presence of more than one mutation underlying the classic form of Tay-Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population."

In transgenic mice, expression of a mutant form of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) can lead to the development of ALS that closely mimics the familial type of ALS (FALS). Although SOD1 mutant mice show phenotypes similar to FALS, dissimilar drug responses and size differences limit their usefulness to study the disease mechanism(s) and identify potential therapeutic compounds. Development of an in vitro model system for ALS is expected to help in obtaining novel insights into disease mechanisms and discovery of therapeutics. We report the establishment of an in vitro FALS model from human embryonic stem cells overexpressing either a wild-type (WT) or a mutant SOD1 (G93A) gene and the evaluation of the phenotypes and survival of the spinal motor neurons (sMNs), which are the neurons affected in ALS patients. The in vitro FALS model that we developed mimics the in vivo human ALS disease in terms of the following: (a) selective degeneration of sMNs expressing the G93A SOD1 but not those expressing the WT gene; (b) susceptibility of G93A SOD1-derived sMNs to form ubiquitinated inclusions; (c) astrocyte-derived factor(s) in the selective degeneration of G93A SOD1 sMNs; and (d) cell-autonomous, as well as non-cell-autonomous, dependent sMN degeneration. Thus, this model is expected to help unravel the disease mechanisms involved in the development of FALS and also lead to potential drug discoveries based on the prevention of neurodegeneration."

Despite evidence that microglia contribute to disease progression, the exact role of these cells in ALS pathology remains unknown. We immunomagnetically isolated microglia from different CNS regions of SOD1(G93A) rats at three different points in disease progression: presymptomatic, symptom onset and end-stage. We observed no differences in microglial number or phenotype in presymptomatic rats compared to wild-type controls. Although after disease onset there was no macrophage infiltration, there were significant increases in microglial numbers in the spinal cord, but not cortex. At disease end-stage, microglia were characterized by high expression of galectin-3, osteopontin and VEGF, and concomitant downregulated expression of TNF\u03b1, IL-6, BDNF and arginase-1. Flow cytometry revealed the presence of at least two phenotypically distinct microglial populations in the spinal cord. Immunohistochemistry showed that galectin-3/osteopontin positive microglia were restricted to the ventral horns of the spinal cord, regions with severe motor neuron degeneration. End-stage SOD1(G93A) microglia from the cortex, a less affected region, displayed similar gene expression profiles to microglia from wild-type rats, and displayed normal responses to systemic inflammation induced by LPS. On the other hand, end-stage SOD1(G93A) spinal microglia had blunted responses to systemic LPS suggesting that in addition to their phenotypic changes, they may also be functionally impaired. Thus, after disease onset, microglia acquired unique characteristics that do not conform to typical M1 (inflammatory) or M2 (anti-inflammatory) phenotypes. This transformation was observed only in the most affected CNS regions, suggesting that overexpression of mutated hSOD1 is not sufficient to trigger these changes in microglia. These novel observations suggest that microglial regional and phenotypic heterogeneity may be an important consideration when designing new therapeutic strategies targeting microglia and neuroinflammation in ALS."

However, induced proliferation was observed in surgically denervated wild-type animals and SOD1-G93A animals at p90, when critical denervation arises. SMSCs from fast and slow muscles were similarly affected by mSOD1 expression. Lowered proliferation rate was generally corroborated with decreased relative MRF expression levels, although this was most prominent in early age and was modulated by muscle type origin. Cyclins controlling cell proliferation did not show modifications in their mRNA levels; however, the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (Cdkn1a), which is known to promote myoblast differentiation, was decreased in SOD1-G93A cultures.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the function of SMSCs is impaired in SOD1-G93A satellite cells from the earliest stages of the disease when no critical motor neuron loss has been described."

However, microglial-derived neurotoxic factors still remain largely unidentified in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. With excitotoxicity being a major mechanism proposed to cause motor neuron death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, our hypothesis was that excessive glutamate release by activated microglia through their system [Formula: see text] (a cystine/glutamate antiporter with the specific subunit xCT/Slc7a11) could contribute to neurodegeneration. Here we show that xCT expression is enriched in microglia compared to total mouse spinal cord and absent from motor neurons. Activated microglia induced xCT expression and during disease, xCT levels were increased in both spinal cord and isolated microglia from mutant SOD1 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mice. Expression of xCT was also detectable in spinal cord post-mortem tissues of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and correlated with increased inflammation. Genetic deletion of xCT in mice demonstrated that activated microglia released glutamate mainly through system [Formula: see text]. Interestingly, xCT deletion also led to decreased production of specific microglial pro-inflammatory/neurotoxic factors including nitric oxide, TNFa and IL6, whereas expression of anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective markers such as Ym1/Chil3 were increased, indicating that xCT regulates microglial functions. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mice, xCT deletion surprisingly led to earlier symptom onset but, importantly, this was followed by a significantly slowed progressive disease phase, which resulted in more surviving motor neurons. These results are consistent with a deleterious contribution of microglial-derived glutamate during symptomatic disease. Therefore, we show that system [Formula: see text] participates in microglial reactivity and modulates amyotrophic lateral sclerosis motor neuron degeneration, revealing system [Formula: see text] inactivation, as a potential approach to slow amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease progression after onset of clinical symptoms."

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spasticity is traditionally thought to be the result of degeneration of the upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, although degeneration of other neuronal types, in particular serotonergic neurons, might also represent a cause of spasticity. We performed a pathology study in seven patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and six control subjects and observed that central serotonergic neurons suffer from a degenerative process with prominent neuritic degeneration, and sometimes loss of cell bodies in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Moreover, distal serotonergic projections to spinal cord motor neurons and hippocampus systematically degenerated in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In SOD1 (G86R) mice, a transgenic model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, serotonin levels were decreased in brainstem and spinal cord before onset of motor symptoms. Furthermore, there was noticeable atrophy of serotonin neuronal cell bodies along with neuritic degeneration at disease onset. We hypothesized that degeneration of serotonergic neurons could underlie spasticity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and investigated this hypothesis in vivo using tail muscle spastic-like contractions in response to mechanical stimulation as a measure of spasticity. In SOD1 (G86R) mice, tail muscle spastic-like contractions were observed at end-stage. Importantly, they were abolished by 5-hydroxytryptamine-2b/c receptors inverse agonists. In line with this, 5-hydroxytryptamine-2b receptor expression was strongly increased at disease onset. In all, we show that serotonergic neurons degenerate during amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and that this might underlie spasticity in mice. Further research is needed to determine whether inverse agonists of 5-hydroxytryptamine-2b/c receptors could be of interest in treating spasticity in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."

Subsequently, fibronectin levels were determined with ELISA in 68 DMD patients, 38 milder Becker muscular dystrophy patients, 33 patients with other neuromuscular disorders, and 15 age-matched adult and child controls.\nRESULTS: There was a significant increase in fibronectin levels in DMD patients compared to age-matched controls. Fibronectin levels in patients with Becker muscular dystrophy, Bethlem myopathy, or myasthenia gravis were comparable to control levels. Progressive elevation in fibronectin levels was observed in longitudinal samples from 22 DMD patients followed up for a period of 6 months up to 4 years.\nCONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study suggests that serum fibronectin levels may constitute a promising biomarker to monitor disease progression in DMD patients."

TDP-43 is a nuclear protein that colocalizes with Cajal body or Gem in cultured cells. Several recent studies have reported that the decreasing number of Gems accompanied the depletion of the causative genes for ALS, TDP-43 and FUS. Gems play an important role in the pathogenesis of spinal muscular atrophy. Gems are the sites of the maturation of spliceosomes, which are composed of uridylate-rich (U) snRNAs (small nuclear RNAs) and protein complex, small nuclear ribonuclearprotein (snRNP). Spliceosomes regulate the splicing of pre-mRNA and are classified into the major or minor classes, according to the consensus sequence of acceptor and donor sites of pre-mRNA splicing. Although the major class of spliceosomes regulates most pre-mRNA splicing, minor spliceosomes also play an important role in regulating the splicing or global speed of pre-mRNA processing. A mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy, in which the number of Gems is decreased, shows fewer subsets U snRNAs. Interestingly, in the central nervous system, U snRNAs belonging to the minor spliceosomes are markedly reduced. In ALS, the U12 snRNA is decreased only in the tissue affected by ALS and not in other tissues. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the decreased U12 snRNA resulting in cell dysfunction and cell death in motor neuron diseases remain unclear, these findings suggest that the disturbance of nuclear bodies and minor splicing may underlie the common molecular pathogenesis of motor neuron diseases."

TDP-43 associates with nuclear bodies including Gemini of coiled bodies (GEMs). GEMs contribute to the biogenesis of uridine-rich small nuclear RNA (U snRNA), a component of splicing machinery. The number of GEMs and a subset of U snRNAs decrease in spinal muscular atrophy, a lower motor neuron disease, suggesting that alteration of U snRNAs may also underlie the molecular pathogenesis of ALS. Here, we investigated the number of GEMs and U11/12-type small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) by immunohistochemistry and the level of U snRNAs using real-time quantitative RT-PCR in ALS tissues. GEMs decreased in both TDP-43-depleted HeLa cells and spinal motor neurons in ALS patients. Levels of several U snRNAs decreased in TDP-43-depleted SH-SY5Y and U87-MG cells. The level of U12 snRNA was decreased in tissues affected by ALS (spinal cord, motor cortex and thalamus) but not in tissues unaffected by ALS (cerebellum, kidney and muscle). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the decrease in U11/12-type snRNP in spinal motor neurons of ALS patients. These findings suggest that loss of TDP-43 function decreases the number of GEMs, which is followed by a disturbance of pre-mRNA splicing by the U11/U12 spliceosome in tissues affected by ALS."

Diagnosis of both, acute myocardial infarction and beta-thalassaemia trait, was based on the standard clinical and laboratory criteria. We found that patients with acute myocardial infarction had low frequency of beta-thalassaemia trait (4.31%), as compared with the mean incidence of heterozygosity for beta-thalassaemia in the whole Greek population (7.61%) (p < 0.02). This finding was more clear in the older age groups of the patients studied. No statistically significant differences were found in the frequency of beta-thalassaemia trait between control subjects (8.49%) and the whole Greek population. We concluded that the heterozygosity for beta-thalassaemia may protect the carrier from acute myocardial infarction. This effect is probably related to low serum cholesterol levels, slight anaemia, and microcytosis lowering the blood viscosity. These changes are usually present in the beta-thalassaemia trait carriers."

Effects on heart, disease substrate, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and safety were also assessed.\nRESULTS: Fifty-seven adults (56% female) receiving ERT (88% had multiorgan disease) were randomised (1.5:1), based on a preliminary cell-based assay of responsiveness to migalastat, to receive 18\u2005months open-label migalastat or remain on ERT. Four patients had non-amenable mutant forms of \u03b1-Gal based on the validated cell-based assay conducted after treatment initiation and were excluded from primary efficacy analyses only. Migalastat and ERT had similar effects on renal function. Left ventricular mass index decreased significantly with migalastat treatment (-6.6\u2005g/m2 (-11.0 to -2.2)); there was no significant change with ERT. Predefined renal, cardiac or cerebrovascular events occurred in 29% and 44% of patients in the migalastat and ERT groups, respectively. Plasma globotriaosylsphingosine remained low and stable following the switch from ERT to migalastat. PROs were comparable between groups.

Baseline alpha-Gal A levels ranged from 0 to 52% of normal. Increases in alpha-Gal A levels (1.5- to 28-fold) after continuous DGJ incubation for 5 days were seen for 49 different missense mutant forms with varying EC(50) values (820 nmol/L to >1 mmol/L). Amino acid substitutions in responsive forms were located throughout both structural domains of the enzyme. Half of the missense mutant forms associated with classic (early-onset) Fabry disease and a majority (90%) associated with later-onset Fabry disease were responsive. In cultured fibroblasts from males with Fabry disease, the responses to DGJ were comparable to those of lymphoblasts with the same mutation. Importantly, elevated GL-3 levels in responsive Fabry fibroblasts were reduced after DGJ incubation, indicating that increased mutant alpha-Gal A levels can reduce accumulated substrate.

CNS involvement remains a major challenge for many LSD and innovative research and approaches are needed to address the fact that recombinant enzymes do not cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore are not expected to lead to any improvement in CNS damages, except if alternative routes such as intrathecal administration would be developed. Molecular chaperones (e.g. migalastat for Fabry disease) and inhibitors of glucosylceramide synthesis (e.g. eliglustat tartrate for Gaucher disease) are currently under investigation in various clinical trials."

In this study, we developed a cell-based assay in cultured HEK-293 cells to identify mutant forms of \u03b1-Gal A that are responsive to AT1001. Concentration-dependent increases in \u03b1-Gal A activity in response to AT1001 were shown for 49 (60%) of 81 mutant forms. The responses of \u03b1-Gal A mutant forms were generally consistent with the responses observed in male Fabry patient-derived lymphoblasts. Importantly, the HEK-293 cell responses of 19 \u03b1-Gal A mutant forms to a clinically achievable concentration of AT1001 (10\u2009\u00b5M) were generally consistent with observed increases in \u03b1-Gal A activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from male Fabry patients orally administered AT1001 during Phase 2 clinical studies. This indicates that the cell-based responses can identify mutant forms of \u03b1-Gal A that are likely to respond to AT1001 in vivo. Thus, the HEK-293 cell-based assay may be a useful aid in the identification of Fabry patients with AT1001-responsive mutant forms."

Migalastat, an oral pharmacologic chaperone, stabilizes specific mutant forms of \u03b1-galactosidase, increasing enzyme trafficking to lysosomes.\nMETHODS: The initial assay of mutant \u03b1-galactosidase forms that we used to categorize 67 patients with Fabry's disease for randomization to 6 months of double-blind migalastat or placebo (stage 1), followed by open-label migalastat from 6 to 12 months (stage 2) plus an additional year, had certain limitations. Before unblinding, a new, validated assay showed that 50 of the 67 participants had mutant \u03b1-galactosidase forms suitable for targeting by migalastat. The primary end point was the percentage of patients who had a response (\u226550% reduction in the number of globotriaosylceramide inclusions per kidney interstitial capillary) at 6 months. We assessed safety along with disease substrates and renal, cardiovascular, and patient-reported outcomes.\nRESULTS: The primary end-point analysis, involving patients with mutant \u03b1-galactosidase forms that were suitable or not suitable for migalastat therapy, did not show a significant treatment effect: 13 of 32 patients (41%) who received migalastat and 9 of 32 patients (28%) who received placebo had a response at 6 months (P=0.30). Among patients with suitable mutant \u03b1-galactosidase who received migalastat for up to 24 months, the annualized changes from baseline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and measured GFR were -0.30\u00b10.66 and -1.51\u00b11.33 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) of body-surface area, respectively. The left-ventricular-mass index decreased significantly from baseline (-7.7 g per square meter; 95% confidence interval [CI], -15.4 to -0.01), particularly when left ventricular hypertrophy was present (-18.6 g per square meter; 95% CI, -38.2 to 1.0). The severity of diarrhea, reflux, and indigestion decreased.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among all randomly assigned patients (with mutant \u03b1-galactosidase forms that were suitable or not suitable for migalastat therapy), the percentage of patients who had a response at 6 months did not differ significantly between the migalastat group and the placebo group.

Based on preclinical data, migalastat HCl in combination with agalsidase is expected to result in the pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancement of agalsidase in plasma by increasing the systemic exposure of active agalsidase, thereby leading to increased cellular levels in disease-relevant tissues. This Phase 2a study design consisted of an open-label, fixed-treatment sequence that evaluated the effects of single oral doses of 150 mg or 450 mg migalastat HCl on the PK and tissue levels of intravenously infused agalsidase (0.2, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg) in male Fabry patients. As expected, intravenous administration of agalsidase alone resulted in increased \u03b1-Gal A activity in plasma, skin, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) compared to baseline. Following co-administration of migalastat HCl and agalsidase, \u03b1-Gal A activity in plasma was further significantly increased 1.2- to 5.1-fold compared to agalsidase administration alone, in 22 of 23 patients (95.6%). Importantly, similar increases in skin and PBMC \u03b1-Gal A activity were seen following co-administration of migalastat HCl and agalsidase. The effects were not related to the administered migalastat HCl dose, as the 150 mg dose of migalastat HCl increased \u03b1-Gal A activity to the same extent as the 450 mg dose.

Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder with a heterogeneous spectrum of clinical manifestations that are caused by the deficiency of \u03b1-galactosidase A (\u03b1-Gal-A) activity. Although useful for diagnosis in males, enzyme activity is not a reliable biochemical marker in heterozygous females due to random X-chromosome inactivation, thus rendering DNA sequencing of the \u03b1-Gal-A gene, alpha-galactosidase gene (GLA), the most reliable test for the confirmation of diagnosis in females. The spectrum of GLA mutations is highly heterogeneous. Many polymorphic GLA variants have been described, but it is unclear if haplotypes formed by combinations of such variants correlate with FD, thus complicating molecular diagnosis in females with normal \u03b1-Gal-A activity. We tested 67 female probands with clinical manifestations that may be associated with FD and 110 control males with normal \u03b1-Gal-A activity. Five different combinations of GLA polymorphic variants were identified in 14 of the 67 females, whereas clearcut pathogenetic alterations, p.Met51Ile and p.Met290Leu, were identified in two cases. The latter has not been reported so far, and both mutant forms were found to be responsive to the pharmacological chaperone deoxygalactonojirimycin (DGJ; migalastat hydrochloride). Analysis of the male control population, as well as male relatives of a suspected FD female proband, permitted the identification of seven different GLA gene haplotypes in strong linkage disequilibrium. The identification of haplotypes in control males provides evidence against their involvement in the development of FD phenotypic manifestations."

It is known that a higher cellular gamma-globin level, e.g., higher ratio of cellular gamma-globin to beta(S)-globin (gamma/beta(S) ratio), inhibits sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization tendency. Hence, therapeutic treatment of sickle cell anemia has been focused on introducing gamma-globin gene into red blood cells to increase the cellular gamma/beta(S) ratio. Here, we have introduced ribozymes and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against beta(S)-globin mRNA into blood cells as a means to increase the gamma/beta(S) ratio.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Single and multiribozymes against beta(S)-globin mRNA have been tested in vitro and in human erythroleukemia K562beta(S) cells that stably express exogenous beta(S)-globin gene. Primary human hematopoietic progenitor cells were also transfected with multiribozyme and the gamma/(gamma + beta) ratio determined and compared with cells transfected with long hairpin beta-globin cDNA and synthetic siRNA genes.\nRESULTS: We have found that the multiribozyme zb21A containing two ribozyme units effectively reduces beta(S)-globin mRNA both in vitro and in K562beta(S) cells. The gamma-globin mRNA to beta(S)-globin mRNA ratio in the multiribozyme transfected cells is about a factor of 2 more than that in the control cells. We have also found that the gamma/(gamma + beta) ratio in the transfected hematopoietic progenitor cells is increased by more than twofold in cells treated with multiribozyme zb21A or siRNA ib5.\nCONCLUSION: Our results suggest that introducing multiribozymes or siRNAs into red blood cells is comparable in their effectiveness to increase the ratio of cellular gamma-globin mRNA to beta- or beta(S)-globin mRNA, providing possible strategies to increase the effectiveness of gamma-globin gene transfer as gene therapy for treatment of patients with sickle cell anemia."

At low oxygen tension, the mutant hemoglobin, sickle hemoglobin, polymerizes inside the red blood cells into a gel or further into fibers leading to a drastic decrease in the red cell deformability.

The present article reviews the historical, genetic, molecular, cellular, and clinical aspects of the disease. A review for the development and design of drugs to treat sickle cell anemia is presented. Anti-sickling agents are classified, based on the target to be modified, into three classes: the gene, the sickle hemoglobin molecule, and the red cell membrane modifiers. In spite of the full understanding of the pathology, physiology, and the molecular nature of the disease, and the development of large number of antisickling agents, a cure for sickle cell anemia still is unavailable. Strategies to treat sickle cell anemia since the early times of the disease state discovery in 1910, has focussed mainly on prophylactic measures to alleviate the painful crises. The article addresses clinical approaches used then and now to treat the disease, and the rationale of their use. Currently in clinical practice, hydroxyurea is the most commonly used agent to treat the disease, and it has been recently approved by the united states Food and Drug Administration as a drug for that purpose."

Clinical severity is diverse, partially due to additional, disease-modifying genetic factors. We are studying one such modifier locus, HMIP (HBS1L-MYB intergenic polymorphism, chromosome 6q23.3). Working with a genetically admixed patient population, we have encountered the necessity to generate haplotype signatures of genetic markers to label genomic fragments with distinct genealogical origin at this locus. With the goal to generate haplotype signatures from patients experimentally, we have investigated the suitability of an existing nanofluidic assay platform to perform phase alignment with single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles.\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patient DNA samples were loaded onto Fluidigm Digital Arrays and individual DNA molecules were assayed with allele-specific probes for SNP markers. Here we present data showing the utility of the nanofluidic approach, yielding haplotype data identical to those obtained with a family-based method. We then determined haplotype composition in a group of patients with sickle cell disease, including in those where a mathematical inference approach gave ambiguous or misleading results. Experimental phasing of genotypes across 3.8 kb for rs9399137, rs9402685, and rs11759553 created unequivocal haplotype signatures for each of the patients. In 68 patients, we found 8 copies of a haplotype signature ('C-C-T'), which is known to be prevalent in Europeans but to be absent in West African populations. We have confirmed the identity of our phased allele pairs by single-molecule sequencing and have demonstrated, in principle, that three-allele phasing (using three colors) is a potential extension to this method.\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Phased haplotypes yield more information than the individual marker genotypes. Procedures such as the one described here would therefore benefit genetic mapping and functional studies as well as diagnostic procedures where the identity or parental origin of short genetic fragments is of importance."

Implementation of this approach for disorders resulting from mutations affecting the beta-globin gene (e.g., beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), however, has been hampered by the inability to generate recombinant viruses able to efficiently and faithfully transmit the necessary sequences for appropriate gene expression. We have addressed this problem by carefully examining the interactions between retroviral and beta-globin gene sequences which affect vector transmission, stability, and expression. First, we examined the transmission properties of a large number of different recombinant proviral genomes which vary both in the precise nature of vector, beta-globin structural gene, and locus control region (LCR) core sequences incorporated and in the placement and orientation of those sequences. Through this analysis, we identified one specific vector, termed M beta 6L, which carries both the human beta-globin gene and core elements HS2, HS3, and HS4 from the LCR and faithfully transmits recombinant proviral sequences to cells with titers greater than 10(6) per ml. Populations of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells transduced by this virus expressed levels of human beta-globin transcript which, on a per gene copy basis, were 78% of the levels detected in an MEL-derived cell line, Hu11, which carries human chromosome 11, the site of the beta-globin locus. Analysis of individual transduced MEL cell clones, however, indicated that, while expression was detected in every clone tested (n = 17), the levels of human beta-globin treatment varied between 4% and 146% of the levels in Hu11. This clonal variation in expression levels suggests that small beta-globin LCR sequences may not provide for as strict chromosomal position-independent expression of beta-globin as previously suspected, at least in the context of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer."

Although the functions of Forkhead box G1 (FOXG1), Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) and Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) have been studied individually, not much is known about their relation to each other with respect to expression levels and regulatory regions. Here we analyzed data from hundreds of mouse and human samples included in the FANTOM5 project, to identify transcript initiation sites, expression levels, expression correlations and regulatory regions of the three genes.\nRESULTS: Our investigations reveal the predominantly used transcription start sites (TSSs) for each gene including novel transcription start sites for FOXG1. We show that FOXG1 expression is poorly correlated with the expression of MECP2 and CDKL5. We identify promoter shapes for each TSS, the predicted location of enhancers for each gene and the common transcription factors likely to regulate the three genes. Our data imply Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) mediated silencing of Foxg1 in cerebellum.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our analyses provide a comprehensive picture of the regulatory regions of the three genes involved in Rett Syndrome."

However, the distribution of phenotypes among newly diagnosed patients has changed substantially over the last 15 years, with cerebral forms of the disease forming a decreasing proportion of new diagnoses. The measurement of plasma very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) alone detects 93% of women who can be proven to be carriers. The addition of genetic linkage studies or assay of VLCFAs in cultured fibroblasts improved this detection rate to the point that there were no obligate carriers who could not be detected using a combination of two or more techniques."

This phenotype, accompanied by kyphoscoliosis and/or ocular fragility, is present in patients with the autosomal recessive type VI form of EDS. These patients have significantly decreased levels of lysyl hydroxylase (LH) activity, due to mutations in the LH1 gene. LH hydroxylates specific lysine residues in the collagen molecule that are precursors for the formation of cross-links which provide collagen with its tensile strength. No disorder has been directly linked to decreased expression of LH2 and LH3, two other isoforms of LH. This study describes 3 patients with mixed phenotypes of EDS, who have significantly decreased mRNAs for LH2, but normal levels of LH1 and LH3 mRNAs, in their skin fibroblasts. In contrast to the effect of LH1 deficiency in EDS VI patients, the decreased expression of LH2 does not affect LH activity, bifunctional collagen cross-links (measured after reduction as dihydroxylysinonorleucine (DHLNL) and hydroxylysinonorleucine (HLNL)), or helical lysine hydroxylation in these cell lines. Sequence analysis of full length LH2 cDNAs and 1kb of the promoter region of LH2 does not show mutations that could explain the decreased expression of LH2. These results suggest that the deficiency of LH2 in these fibroblasts may be caused by changes in other factors required for the expression of LH2."

Sometimes, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome remains undetected until the patient, usually in the pediatric age, shows extensive or severe mucocutaneous injuries after only minor traumas. In this scenario, the misdiagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with child abuse is a possibility, as occasionally reported in the literature. Recently, more attention was posed by lay people between the possible association of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and bone fragility. Literature and personal experience show a strong association between Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, generalized joint hypermobility and reduced bone mass density in older children and adults, especially fertile women. The existence of a true increased risk of fracture in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is still a matter of debate in children and adults with little and conflicting evidence. In case of suspected child abuse, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is certainly on the differential for bruising, especially in EDS types with marked cutaneous and capillary involvement. In suspected child abuse cases, careful examination of the index case and her/his extended family is routine, as well as exclusion of other disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta. The hypothesis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome as an alternative explanation for infantile fractures remains speculative."

We investigated whether cEDS affected the protein synthesis rate in skin and tendon, and whether this could be stimulated in tendon tissue with insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Five patients with cEDS and 10 healthy, matched controls (CTRL) were included. One patellar tendon of each participant was injected with 0.1 ml IGF-I (Increlex, Ipsen, 10 mg/ml) and the contralateral tendon with 0.1 ml isotonic saline as control. The injections were performed at both 24 and 6 h prior to tissue sampling. The fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of proteins in skin and tendon was measured with the stable isotope technique using a flood-primed continuous infusion over 6 h. After the infusion one skin biopsy and two tendon biopsies (one from each patellar tendon) were obtained. We found similar baseline FSR values in skin and tendon in the cEDS patients and controls [skin: 0.005 \u00b1 0.002 (cEDS) and 0.007 \u00b1 0.002 (CTRL); tendon: 0.008 \u00b1 0.001 (cEDS) and 0.009 \u00b1 0.002 (CTRL) %/h, mean \u00b1 SE]. IGF-I injections significantly increased FSR values in cEDS patients but not in controls (delta values: cEDS 0.007 \u00b1 0.002, CTRL 0.001 \u00b1 0.001%/h). In conclusion, baseline protein synthesis rates in connective tissue appeared normal in cEDS patients, and the patients responded with an increased tendon protein synthesis rate to IGF-I injections."

Abnormal pulp shape (13%) and pulp calcification (78%) were observed in subjects affected with classical EDS. Caries experience was higher in EDS compared with controls and was related to poor oral hygiene, influenced by increased mucosal fragility and restraint of (wrist) joint mobility. The overall periodontal status in EDS was poor, with 62% of EDS subjects presenting high periodontal treatment needs (community periodontal index for treatment need, CPITN = II).\nCONCLUSION: Oral health may be severely compromised in EDS as a result of specific alterations of collagen in orofacial structures.

Of the various types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome the most severe is type IV (EDS IV). Early studies showed that fibroblasts from EDS IV patients secreted lower than normal amounts of type III procollagen (Pope et al., 1975). Later, the disease was linked to COL3A1, the gene encoding this protein. More recently, with the publication of full length cDNA and partial characterisation of the gene structure, detailed analysis of mutations in EDS IV patients has become possible. Nineteen different mutations in the type III procollagen gene have been reported in different families with EDS IV. Recent results support the hypothesis that in EDS IV, dominant inheritance should be assumed, in sporadic cases also, unless proven otherwise. Very little is known about the genetics or biochemicals defects responsible for the others EDS subtypes, but with the applications of the tools of molecular biology, analysis of these defects if now within reach."

The Villefranche criteria have simplified its diagnosis, which, however, remains difficult in children and young adults with vascular and hypermobile EDS as well as in patients without a positive family history. Diagnosis of vascular EDS is important for clinical follow-up, genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. We describe the biochemical and molecular-genetic diagnosis of vascular EDS.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe five families with vascular EDS. Analysis of (pro)collagens obtained from cultured fibroblasts was done using SDS-PAGE. The structure and amounts of (pro)collagen I, III and V were determined by autoradioflourography. This was also done in 362 controls or patients without a diagnosis of vascular EDS. Molecular testing was done in Professor Anne de Paepe's laboratory in Belgium by sequencing of COL3A1.\nRESULTS: (Pro)collagen from all five patients with vascular EDS was abnormal by SDS-PAGE: intracellular retention, reduced secretion and overmodification of the a1 chains of (pro)collagen III. Molecular analysis revealed an abnormality of COL3A1 in all patients. Abnormalities of (pro)collagen III were not observed in patients without a diagnosis of vascular EDS. Among 90 patients with non-vascular EDS, one patient had an abnormality of collagen I.\nDISCUSSION: Biochemical analysis of (pro)collagen obtained from cultured fibroblasts is a good screening procedure for vascular EDS, but it is of limited value in non-vascular EDS. Molecular testing will disclose an abnormality of COL3A1 in many patients with abnormal (pro)collagen III on SDS-PAGE. The findings make precise genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis possible in families with vascular EDS."

We evaluated the bone metabolism, bone mineral density (BMD) and bone quality (measured by trabecular bone score, TBS), and the prevalence of vertebral fractures (VFx) in a group of eugonadal adult EDS patients.\nMETHODS: Fifty consecutive Caucasian patients, aged 30-50\u00a0years (36 females, 14 males) with classical or hypermobility EDS and 50 age-, gender-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched control subjects were enrolled. In all subjects' calcium-phosphorous metabolism, bone turnover, BMD at the lumbar spine (LS) and femur (femoral neck, FN and total femur, FT) and TBS by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and the VFx presence by spine radiograph were assessed.\nRESULTS: Patients showed reduced BMD (Z-scores LS -0.45\u2009\u00b1\u20091.00, FN -0.56\u2009\u00b1\u20091.01, FT -0.58\u2009\u00b1\u20090.92) and TBS (1.299\u2009\u00b1\u20090.111) and increased prevalence of morphometric VFx (32\u00a0%) than controls (Z-scores LS 0.09\u2009\u00b1\u20091.22, FN 0.01\u2009\u00b1\u20090.97, FT 0.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.89; TBS 1.382\u2009\u00b1\u20090.176; VFx 8\u00a0%, p <0.05 for all comparisons), while vitamin D levels, calcium-phosphorous metabolism, and bone turnover were comparable.

We investigated whether the deficiency of the tenascins, extracellular-matrix proteins that are highly expressed in connective tissues, was associated with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\nMETHODS: We screened serum samples from 151 patients with the classic, hypermobility, or vascular types of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; 75 patients with psoriasis; 93 patients with rheumatoid arthritis; and 21 healthy persons for the presence of tenascin-X and tenascin-C by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We examined the expression of tenascins and type V collagen in skin by immunohistochemical methods and sequenced the tenascin-X gene.\nRESULTS: Tenascin-X was present in serum from all normal subjects, all patients with psoriasis, all patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and 146 of 151 patients with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Tenascin-X was absent from the serum of the 5 remaining patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, who were unrelated. Tenascin-X deficiency was confirmed in these patients by analysis of skin fibroblasts and by immunostaining of skin. The expression of tenascin-C and type V collagen was normal in these patients. All five of these patients had hypermobile joints, hyperelastic skin, and easy bruising, without atrophic scarring. Tenascin-X mutations were identified in all tenascin-X-deficient patients; one patient had a homozygous tenascin-X gene deletion, one was heterozygous for the deletion, and three others had homozygous truncating point mutations, confirming a causative role for tenascin-X and a recessive pattern of inheritance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Tenascin-X deficiency causes a clinically distinct, recessive form of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This finding indicates that factors other than the collagens or collagen-processing enzymes can cause the syndrome and suggests a central role for tenascin-X in maintaining the integrity of collagenous matrix."

These mutations cause defects in collagen. Collagen, a connective tissue protein that acts like glue, gives strength to the body and provides support and elasticity for movement. Thus, the altered gene affects the mechanical properties of skin, joints, ligaments, and blood vessels. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is transmitted through autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or x-linked patterns of inheritance. The life expectancy of an affected infant varies with the type of EDS. This article provides an overview of the 6 major classifications of EDS, their unique clinical presentations, a focused physical assessment guide, considerations for nursing care, and resources for parents. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can be a potentially debilitating syndrome. It requires preventative and protective measures starting at birth to preserve joint function to improve infant outcomes. Caring for patients with EDS requires an understanding of the potential associated complications to help minimize the physical and emotional impact of the syndrome and improve the quality of life for affected individuals."

Gastrointestinal manifestations in EDS have been described but their frequency, nature and impact are poorly known. We aimed to assess digestive features in a national cohort of EDS patients.\nMETHODS: A questionnaire has been sent to 212 EDS patients through the French patient support group, all of which had been formally diagnosed according to the Villefranche criteria. The questionnaire included questions about digestive functional symptoms, the GIQLI (Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index), KESS scoring system and the Rome III criteria.\nRESULTS: Overall, 135 patients (64% response rate) completed the questionnaire and 134 were analyzable (123 women; 91%). Mean age and Body Mass Index were respectively 35\u00b114.7 years and 24.3\u00b16.1 kg/m(2). The most common EDS subtype was hypermobility form (n=108; 80.6%). GIQLI and KESS median values were respectively 63.5 (27-117) and 19 [13.5-22]. Eighty four percent of patients had functional bowel disorders (FBD) according to the Rome III criteria. An irritable bowel syndrome according to the same criteria was observed in 64 patients (48%) and 48 patients (36%) reported functional constipation. A gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) was reported in 90 patients (68.7%), significantly associated with a poorer GIQLI (60.5\u00b116.8 versus 75.9\u00b120.3; p<0.0001). GIQLI was also negatively impacted by the presence of an irritable bowel syndrome or functional constipation (p=0.007). There was a significant correlation between FBD and GERD.\nCONCLUSIONS: Natural frequency of gastrointestinal manifestations in EDS seems higher than previously assessed. FBD and GERD are very common in our study population, the largest ever published until now. Their impact is herein shown to be important. A systematic clinical assessment of digestive features should be recommended in EDS."

Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) is a human neuronal migration disorder characterised by seizures and conglomerates of neural cells around the lateral ventricles of the brain, caused by FLNA mutations. FLNA encodes filamin A, an actin binding protein involved in cytoskeletal organisation. The amino-terminal actin binding domain (ABD) of filamins contains two tandem calponin homology domains, CHD1 and CHD2.\nOBJECTIVE: To report clinical and genetic analyses in a Spanish family affected by a connective tissue disorder suggestive of EDS type III and PNH.\nMETHODS: A clinical and molecular study was undertaken in the three affected women. Clinical histories, physical and neurological examinations, brain magnetic resonance imaging studies, and skin biopsies were done. Genetic analysis of the FLNA gene was undertaken by direct sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.\nRESULTS: Mutation analysis of the FLNA gene resulted in the identification of a novel mutation in exon 3 (c.383C-->T) segregating with the combination of both syndromes. This mutation results in a substitution of an alanine residue (A128V) in CHD1.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the Ala128Val mutation causes the dual EDS-PNH phenotype. This association constitutes a new variant within the EDS spectrum. This is the first description of a familial EDS-PNH association with a mutation in FLNA."

Both disorders have benefited from recent advances in clinical and molecular characterization, allowing improvements in clinical diagnosis and management. EDS are a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by skin hyperextensibility, atrophic scarring, joint hypermobility and generalized tissue fragility. The current classification proposes six subtypes based on clinical, biochemical and molecular characteristics. However, examples of unclassified variants and 'overlap phenotypes' are becoming more common. Mutations in genes encoding fibrillar collagens or collagen-modifying enzymes have been identified in most forms of EDS, including the classic and vascular subtypes (collagen type V and III, respectively), and the rare arthrochalasis, kyphoscoliosis and dermatosparaxis variants (type I collagen defects). To date, the genetic background of the hypermobility type of EDS remains unclear, although some new insights have been gained recently. MFS is an autosomal-dominant disorder that affects the cardiovascular, ocular and skeletal system with aortic root dilation/dissection, ectopia lentis and bone overgrowth, respectively. Advances in therapeutic, mainly surgical, techniques have improved median survival significantly, yet severe morbidity and a substantial risk for premature mortality remain associated. The disorder is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, encoding the microfibrillar protein fibrillin-1. Recently, new insights in the pathogenesis changed the prevailing concept of this type 1 fibrillinopathy as a structural disorder of the connective tissue into a developmental abnormality manifesting perturbed cytokine signalling. These findings have opened new and unexpected targets for aetiologically directed drug treatments."

It comprises Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type II, but it is now apparent that these form a continuum of clinical findings and differ only in phenotypic severity. It is currently estimated that approximately 50% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harbor mutations in the COL5A1 and the COL5A2 gene, encoding the \u03b11 and the \u03b12-chain of type V collagen, respectively. However, because no prospective molecular studies of COL5A1 and COL5A2 have been performed in a clinically well-defined patient group, this number may underestimate the real proportion of patients with classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harboring a mutation in one of these genes. In the majority of patients with molecularly characterized classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the disease is caused by a mutation leading to a nonfunctional COL5A1 allele and resulting in haploinsufficiency of type V collagen. A smaller proportion of patients harbor a structural mutation in COL5A1 or COL5A2, causing the production of a functionally defective type V collagen protein. Most mutations identified so far result in a reduced amount of type V collagen in the connective tissues available for collagen fibrillogenesis. Inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variability is observed, but no genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed. No treatment for the underlying defect is presently available for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. However, a series of preventive guidelines are applicable."

Because the fibrillar collagens are major structural components of connective tissue, the hypothesis has long been set forth that the Marfan syndrome is a disorder of fibrillar collagen. We have investigated this hypothesis by performing linkage studies in 12 multiplex families with the Marfan syndrome, using restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP's) associated with 3 genes encoding chains of fibrillar collagens. The data exclude linkage to all 3 candidate genes in 2 families and at least 1 of the candidates is excluded in 6 additional families. Each candidate was excluded in at least 3 families. In no case was strong evidence in favor of linkage of the Marfan syndrome to any of the 3 genes observed. These data speak against the hypothesis that mutations in one or more of these 3 fibrillar collagens cause the classic Marfan syndrome."

Until recently, microfibrils, one component of the ECM, were thought primarily to serve as a scaffolding on which elastin is deposited during development to form elaunin fibres [1]. The most prominent protein that forms mammalian microfibrils is fibrillin. It is known that mutations in the fibrillin gene cause a heterogenous connective tissue disease called Marfan syndrome [2], so information on mechanical properties of microfibrils or their role in tissue function would be useful. Microfibrils are also found in the ECM of some invertebrate tissues, and there is growing evidence that the protein forming the structure is homologous to mammalian fibrillin [3,4]. It has been shown that the microfibril-based arterial wall of the lobster has viscoelastic properties [5], and we have now utilized this primitive artery to measure the modulus of elasticity of microfibrils. It is similar to that of the rubber-like protein elastin."

This statement is supported by the observations that the classic Marfan phenotype cosegregates with intragenic and/or flanking marker alleles in all families tested and that a significant number of FBN1 mutations have been identified in affected individuals. We have now devised a method to screen the entire coding sequence and flanking splice junctions of FBN1. On completion for a panel of nine probands with classic MFS, six new mutations were identified that accounted for disease in seven (78%) of nine patients. Nine additional new mutations have been characterized in the early stages of a larger screening project. These 15 mutations were equally distributed throughout the gene and, with one exception, were specific to single families. One-third of mutations created premature termination codons, and 6 of 15 substituted residues with putative significance for calcium binding to epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains. Mutations causing severe and rapidly progressive disease that presents in the neonatal period can occur in a larger region of the gene than previously demonstrated, and the nature of the mutation is as important a determinant as its location, in predisposing to this phenotype."

Frequent observation of cattle with a normal withers height, but lower body weight than age-matched normal cattle, was recently reported among cattle sired by phenotypically normal Bull A, in Japanese Black cattle. These cattle also showed other characteristic features similar to the clinical phenotype of human MFS, such as a long phalanx proximalis, oval face and crystalline lens cloudiness. We first screened a paternal half-sib family comprising 36 affected and 10 normal offspring of Bull A using the BovineSNP50 BeadChip (illumina). Twenty-two microsatellite markers mapped to a significant region on BTA10 were subsequently genotyped on the family. The bovine Marfan syndrome-like disease (MFSL) was mapped onto BTA10. As FBN1 is located in the significant region, FBN1 was sequenced in Bull A, and three affected and one normal cattle. A G>A mutation at the intron64 splicing accepter site (c.8227-1G>A) was detected in 31 of 36 affected animals (84.7%). The c.8227-1G>A polymorphism was not found in 20 normal offspring of Bull A or in 93 normal cattle unrelated to Bull A. The mutation caused a 1-base shift of the intron64 splicing accepter site to the 3' direction, and a 1-base deletion in processed mRNA. This 1-base deletion creates a premature termination codon, and a 125-amino acid shorter Fibrillin-1 protein is produced from the mutant mRNA. We therefore conclude that the c.8227-1G>A mutation is causative for MFSL. Furthermore, it was suggested that Bull A exhibited germline mosaicism for the mutation, and that the frequency of the mutant sperm was 14.9%."

Histologic characterization of the effect of FBN1 mutations on fibrillin-1 cellular processing and microfibril formation has provided insights into fibrillin-1 function. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV results from mutations in the COL3A1 gene, which encodes the polypeptides in type III collagen. Despite advances in the molecular genetics of these two disorders, there is not a molecular diagnostic test for these syndromes based on the identification of gene mutations.

A cysteine to serine substitution at codon 1409 (C1409S) was identified in an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like motif from one fibrillin allele which segregates with the disease phenotype through three generations of a family affected with the Marfan syndrome. This alteration was not observed in 60 probands from other families or in 88 unrelated normal individuals. The altered cysteine is completely conserved in all EGF-like motifs identified in fibrillin, and in all proteins that contain this motif. These observations strongly indicate that C1409S is the disease-producing mutation in this family. The phenotype of individuals carrying C1409S varied widely with respect to onset of disease, organ-system involvement, and clinical severity; certain affected adults were unaware of their status before being diagnosed through this investigation. We conclude that fibrillin gene defects cause familial Marfan syndrome, that mutations in the EGF-like motif of the fibrillin gene are not uniformly associated with severe disease, and that fibrillin genotype is not the sole determinant of Marfan phenotype."

Mutations within the fibrillin-1 gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), a heritable disease of connective tissue. More than 60% of MFS-causing mutations identified are localized to cbEGFs, emphasizing that the native properties of these domains are critical for fibrillin-1 function. The cbEGF12-13 domain pair is within the longest run of cbEGFs, and many mutations that cluster in this region are associated with severe, neonatal MFS. The NMR solution structure of Ca(2+)-loaded cbEGF12-13 exhibits a near-linear, rod-like arrangement of domains. This observation supports the hypothesis that all fibrillin-1 (cb)EGF-cbEGF pairs, characterized by a single interdomain linker residue, possess this rod-like structure. The domain arrangement of cbEGF12-13 is stabilized by additional interdomain packing interactions to those observed for cbEGF32-33, which may help to explain the previously reported higher calcium binding affinity of cbEGF13. Based on this structure, a model of cbEGF11-15 that encompasses all known neonatal MFS missense mutations has highlighted a potential binding region. Backbone dynamics data confirm the extended structure of cbEGF12-13 and lend support to the hypothesis that a correlation exists between backbone flexibility and cbEGF domain calcium affinity. These results provide important insight into the potential consequences of MFS-associated mutations for the assembly and biomechanical properties of connective tissue microfibrils."

We identified 56 mutations in 62 of the 157 (40%) families including 49 single-base substitutions (36 missense mutations, seven nonsense mutations, and six splicing sites), one small insertion, four small deletions, one small indel (insertion and deletion), and one exonic deletion (Exon 36).

That finding implies that family history and the Ghent criteria play a more important role than clinical manifestations in establishing a clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. Among the 56 mutations found in this study, 40 (71%) have not been registered in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) or in the Universal Mutation Database (UMD).

A total of 75 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons (179-301bp, average 256bp) that covered the complete coding regions and splicing sites were evaluated on the 96-well LightCycler system. Melting curves were analyzed as fluorescence derivative plots (-dF/dT vs. temperature). To determine the sensitivity of this method, a total of 82 samples from patients with Marfan syndrome and 50 unaffected individuals were analyzed. All mutations reported in this study had been confirmed previously by direct sequencing analysis. Melting analysis identified 48 heterozygous variants. The variant c.3093 G>T (exon 25) was incorrectly identified by melting curve analysis. The sensitivity of the technique in this sample was 98.78% (81/82).

The fibrillin gene is the site of mutations causing Marfan's syndrome. This disorder shows a high degree of clinical variability both between and within families. Each family appears to have a unique mutation in the fibrillin gene, which precludes the routine use of mutation screening for presymptomatic diagnosis of the disorder. The goal of this study was to develop a widely applicable method of molecular diagnosis.\nMETHODS: We used three newly characterized intragenic sites of normal DNA repeat-sequence variation (i.e., polymorphisms) as markers to follow the inheritance pattern of specific copies (alleles) of the fibrillin gene in multiple kindreds with various clinical features of Marfan's syndrome.\nRESULTS: The polymorphic markers allowed identification of the particular copy of the fibrillin gene that cosegregated with Marfan's syndrome in 13 of the 14 families tested. In 11 families a definite presymptomatic diagnosis of Marfan's syndrome could be made in family members who had only equivocal manifestations of the disorder. In two other families, some family members demonstrated either classic Marfan's syndrome or a milder but closely related phenotype. The copy of the fibrillin gene that cosegregated with classic Marfan's syndrome was not inherited by family members with the latter, atypical, form of the disease. These milder phenotypes, previously diagnosed as Marfan's syndrome, were not associated with aortic involvement.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results document the usefulness of novel polymorphic DNA repeat sequences in the presymptomatic diagnosis of Marfan's syndrome. Our findings also demonstrate that the various clinical phenotypes seen in selected families may be due not to single fibrillin mutations, but rather to different genetic alterations. These findings underscore the need for a modification of the current diagnostic criteria for Marfan's syndrome in order to achieve accurate risk assessment."

The main clinical features included mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency, aortic root dilatation, arachnodactyly, and loose skin. Despite the presence of severe and inoperable heart anomalies, the girl was quite stable on symptomatic treatment and lived up to the 7th month of age when she died due to cardiorespiratory failure. Molecular-genetic studies revealed a novel intronic c.4211-32_-13del mutation in the FBN1 gene. Subsequent in vitro splicing analysis showed this mutation led to exon 35 skipping, presumably resulting in a deletion of 42 amino acids (p.Leu1405_Asp1446del). Interestingly, this mutation is localized outside the region of exons 24-32, whose mutation is responsible for the substantial majority of cases of neonatal MFS. Although the family history of MFS was negative, the subsequent molecular genetic examination documented a mosaicism of the same mutation in the maternal blood cells (10-25% of genomic DNA) and the detailed clinical examination showed unilateral lens ectopy."

The aim of our study was to investigate the role of dural ectasia in raising the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and its association with FBN1 mutations. We studied 40 unrelated patients suspected for MFS, who underwent magnetic resonance imaging searching for dural ectasia. In all of them FBN1 gene analysis was also performed. Thirty-seven patients resulted affected by Marfan syndrome according to the '96 Ghent criteria; in 30 of them the diagnosis was confirmed when revaluated by the recently revised criteria (2010). Thirty-six patients resulted positive for dural ectasia. The degree of dural ectasia was grade 1 in 19 patients, grade 2 in 11 patients, and grade 3 in 6 patients. In 7 (24%) patients, the presence of dural ectasia allowed to reach a positive score for systemic feature criterion. Twenty-four patients carried an FBN1 mutation, that were represented by 13 missense (54%), and 11 (46%) mutations generating a premature termination codon (PTC, frameshifts and stop codons). No mutation was detected in the remaining 16 (6 patients with MFS and 10 with related disorders according to revised Ghent criteria).

In patient 1 carrying the 14q32 microdeletion, tall stature and renal malformation were unexplained by paternal UPD(14), and there was no altered DLK1 expression or unexpected methylation status. By WES and filtering with a mining tool, a novel FBN1 missense variant was found in patient 1 and his mother, who both showed clinical features of Marfan syndrome by thorough anthropometric assessment, and a novel EYA1 missense variant as a probable cause of the renal malformation in the patient. In patient 2 with the 22q11.21 microduplication syndrome, skin hypo- and hyperpigmentation and two malignancies were only partially explained. By WES, compound heterozygous BLM stop founder mutations were detected causing Bloom syndrome. In male patient 3 carrying a 22q11.21 microduplication inherited from his unaffected father, WES identified a novel missense variant in the OPHN1 X-linked intellectual disability gene inherited from the unaffected mother as a possible additional cause for developmental delay. Thus, WES seems warranted in patients carrying microdeletions or microduplications, who have unexplained clinical features or microimbalances inherited from an unaffected parent."

The availability of international FBN1 mutation Universal Mutation Database (UMD-FBN1) has allowed us to perform the largest collaborative study ever reported, to investigate the correlation between the FBN1 genotype and the nature and severity of the clinical phenotype. A range of qualitative and quantitative clinical parameters (skeletal, cardiovascular, ophthalmologic, skin, pulmonary, and dural) was compared for different classes of mutation (types and locations) in 1,013 probands with a pathogenic FBN1 mutation. A higher probability of ectopia lentis was found for patients with a missense mutation substituting or producing a cysteine, when compared with other missense mutations. Patients with an FBN1 premature termination codon had a more severe skeletal and skin phenotype than did patients with an inframe mutation. Mutations in exons 24-32 were associated with a more severe and complete phenotype, including younger age at diagnosis of type I fibrillinopathy and higher probability of developing ectopia lentis, ascending aortic dilatation, aortic surgery, mitral valve abnormalities, scoliosis, and shorter survival; the majority of these results were replicated even when cases of neonatal MFS were excluded. These correlations, found between different mutation types and clinical manifestations, might be explained by different underlying genetic mechanisms (dominant negative versus haploinsufficiency) and by consideration of the two main physiological functions of fibrillin-1 (structural versus mediator of TGF beta signalling).

The Marfan score calculated for phenotype data from the records quantified variant associations with Marfan syndrome phenotype. We calculated a Marfan score for 1,283 variants, of which we confirmed the database diagnosis of Marfan syndrome in 77.1%.

Molecular diagnosis in families with Marfan syndrome can be undertaken by using intragenic FBN1 gene markers to identify and track the disease allele. However, in sporadic cases, which constitute up to 30% of the total, DNA-based diagnosis cannot be performed using linked markers but rather requires the identification of the specific FBN1 gene mutation. Due to the size and complexity of the FBN1 gene, identification of a causative Marfan syndrome mutation is not a trivial undertaking. Herein, we describe a comprehensive approach to the molecular diagnosis of Marfan syndrome that relies on the direct analysis of the FBN1 gene at the cDNA level and detects both coding sequence mutations and those leading to exon-skipping, which are often missed by analysis at the genomic DNA level. The ability to consistently determine the specific FBN1 gene mutation responsible for a particular case of Marfan syndrome allows both prenatal and pre-implantation diagnosis, even in sporadic instances of the disease."

Individuals with this Marfanoid disorder lack the ocular findings of Marfan syndrome and often have dysmorphic features such as unusual facies, cleft palate, and contractures. In addition, Loeys-Dietz syndrome patients often present in childhood with significant cardiovascular problems.

FBN1 mutations have been associated with a broad spectrum of phenotypes. Neonatal Marfan syndrome has unique clinical manifestations and mutations.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine if there is a discernible genotypic-phenotypic correlation associated with the unique mutation in neonatal Marfan syndrome.\nSTUDY DESIGN: A newborn exhibited many typical characteristics of neonatal Marfan syndrome, including arachnodactyly; contractures of both elbows, knees, and ankles; small-joint laxity; dilated cardiomyopathy; valvular dysplasia and insufficiency; congestive heart failure; and pulmonary emphysema. Three atypical features were also discovered: a right diaphragmatic hernia, a myocardial mass, and left main-stem bronchomalacia. She died at 3(1/2) months of age. Total RNA was extracted from skin fibroblasts and amplified by means of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification with FBN1-specific primers. The complementary DNA fragments were sequenced.\nRESULTS: A single T-to-C transition at nucleotide 3276 (T3276C) was identified and confirmed at the DNA level by sequencing of genomic DNA. This results in a substitution of threonine for isoleucine.\nCONCLUSIONS: Neonatal Marfan syndrome is a unique clinical entity with recurring mutation hot spots in exons 24 to 27 and 31 to 32 of the FBN1 gene.

As genetic sequencing becomes better, cheaper, and more accessible, the expected increase in the number of genetic tests will become evident, resulting in numerous genetic variants that need to be evaluated for disease-causing effects based on database information. The aim of this study was to evaluate genetic variants in four databases and review the relevant literature.\nMETHODS: We assessed background data on 23 common variants registered in ESP6500 and classified as causing MFS in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). We evaluated data in four variant databases (HGMD, UMD-FBN1, ClinVar, and UniProt) according to the diagnostic criteria for MFS and compared the results with the classification of each variant in the four databases.\nRESULTS: None of the 23 variants was clearly associated with MFS, even though all classifications in the databases stated otherwise.\nCONCLUSION: A genetic diagnosis of MFS cannot reliably be based on current variant databases because they contain incorrectly interpreted conclusions on variants. Variants must be evaluated by time-consuming review of the background material in the databases and by combining these data with expert knowledge on MFS. This is a major problem because we expect even more genetic test results in the near future as a result of the reduced cost and process time for next-generation sequencing.Genet Med 18 1, 98-102."

We identified a missense mutation in one patient, D1155N in exon 27. Dermal fibroblasts from the affected individual were used to study the effect of the missense mutation D1155N on fibrillin-1 cellular processing.

FBN1 mutations can also cause other phenotypes, such as ectopia lentis (EL) and familial isolated thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (FAA). When the clinical presentation is typical, diagnosis of MFS is usually easy to make. However, there can be a marked phenotypic variation between affected subjects even in one family, and making the diagnosis can be challenging, especially in childhood. The objective of this study was to test the sensitivity of conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) for detecting mutations in FBN1 in MFS and related phenotypes.\nDESIGN: Setting up CSGE analysis for the FBN1 gene and testing the method first by screening coded samples from 17 MFS patients with previously detected FBN1 mutations. We then used a test set consisting of 46 coded samples representing MFS, related phenotypes, and controls.\nRESULTS: Sixteen of the 17 known mutations were detected. Altogether 23 mutations were detected in a test set consisting of 46 coded samples representing MFS, related phenotypes, and controls. Nineteen of the mutations were novel. The mutation was detected in 18 of the 20 MFS patients and in one patient with familial EL, but not in a patient with sporadic MASS syndrome, any of the five sporadic annuloaortic ectasia (AAE) patients, or any of the 15 controls. A FBN1 mutation was detected in four members of a multigeneration family with AAE, however.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that CSGE is highly sensitive for the detection of mutations in FBN1, and that molecular diagnostics is a useful means of confirming clinical diagnoses of MFS and related disorders.

Fibrillin-1 is a major component of the 10-12 nm microfibrils, which are thought to play a role in tropoelastin deposition and elastic fibre formation in addition to possessing an anchoring function in some tissues. Fibrillin-1 mutations have also been found in patients who do not fulfil clinical criteria for the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, but have related disorders of connective tissue, such as isolated ectopia lentis, familial aortic aneurysm, and Marfan-like skeletal abnormalities, so that Marfan syndrome may be regarded as one of a range of type 1 fibrillinopathies. There appear to be no particular hot spots since mutations are found throughout the entire fibrillin-1 gene. However, a clustering of mutations associated with the most severe form of Marfan syndrome, neonatal Marfan syndrome, has been noted in a region encompassing exons 24 to 32. The gene for fibrillin-2 (FBN2) is highly homologous to FBN1, and mutations in FBN2 have been shown to cause a phenotypically related disorder termed congenital contractural arachnodactyly. Since mutations in the fibrillin genes are likely to affect the global function of the microfibrils, the term microfibrillopathy may be the most appropriate to designate the spectrum of disease associated with dysfunction of these molecules. The understanding of the global and the molecular functions of the fibrillin containing microfibrils is still incomplete and, correspondingly, no comprehensive theory of the pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome has emerged to date. Many, but not all, fibrillin-1 gene mutations are expected to exert a dominant negative effect, whereby mutant fibrillin monomers impair the global function of the microfibrils.

Like Marfan syndrome, this condition is accompanied by skeletal abnormalities; however, flexion joint contractures replace the loose-jointedness of Marfan syndrome and, more importantly, neither the eye nor the aorta are affected. More recently, a similar association with the fibrillin gene has also been established in the dominantly inherited form of ectopia lentis.

At least one component of the Ghent nosology, insufficient alone to make a minor criterion, was found in the majority of patients with isolated ascending aortic dilatation and isolated EL. In patients with isolated EL, missense mutations involving a cysteine were predominant, mutations in exons 24-32 were underrepresented, and no mutations leading to a premature truncation were found. Studies of recurrent mutations and affected family members of propositi with only one major clinical criterion argue for a clinical continuum between such phenotypes and classical MFS.

Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome and related connective tissue disorders (fibrillinopathies) that show autosomal dominant inheritance. The pathogenic mechanism is thought to be a dominant negative effect of a mutant protein on microfibril assembly, although direct evidence is lacking. A significant group of disease-causing FBN1 mutations are cysteine substitutions within EGF domains that are predicted to cause misfolding by removal of disulphide bonds that stabilize the native domain fold. We have studied three missense mutations (C1117Y, C1129Y and G1127S) to investigate the effect of misfolding on the trafficking of fibrillin-1 from fibroblast cells. We demonstrate that both C1117Y and C1129Y, expressed as recombinant fragments of fibrillin-1, are retained and accumulate within the cell. Both undergo core glycosylation but lack the complex glycosylation observed in the secreted wild-type fragment, suggesting retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In addition, co-immunoprecipitation experiments show association with the ER chaperone calreticulin, but not calnexin, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (Grp78/BiP) or protein disulfide isomerase. In contrast, G1127S, which causes a moderate change in the EGF domain fold, shows a pattern of glycosylation and trafficking profile indistinguishable from the wild-type fragment. Since expression of the recombinant fragments does not disrupt the secretion of endogenous fibrillin-1 by the cell, we propose that G1127S causes disease via an extracellular dominant negative effect. In contrast, the observed ER retention of C1117Y and C1129Y suggests that disease associated with these missense mutations is caused either by an intracellular dominant negative effect or haploinsufficiency."

Cardiovascular complications, such as aortic aneurysm and dissection drastically reduce life expectancy of individuals with MfS, whereas preventive surgery substantially improves the prognosis of these patients. A number of mutations in the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene associated with MfS have been identified to date, demonstrating considerable molecular heterogeneity. One region, however, located around exon 24, exhibits a striking clustering of mutations, which are associated with a severe, socalled neonatal form of MfS. Here we report the first mutation (G2950A) in exon 24 of the neonatal region of the FBN1 gene, associated with a classic MfS phenotype. The mutation leads to the subsitution of valin by isoleucin (V984I), both uncharged amino acids, which only differ in a single methyl group. This defect was identified in a proband with cardiovascular manifestations of MfS by SSCP analysis of PCR-amplified genomic DNA, direct PCR sequencing and RFLP analysis. The substitution was neither detected in the unaffected 4-year old daughter of the proband, nor in 3 of his healthy family members nor in 108 allels from control individuals, suggesting that this mutation is causative for MfS in the patient. Since no other family member of the proband is affected by MfS, the defect described is sporadic. In summary, we identified a novel defect in exon 24 of the neonatal region of the FBN1 gene in a patient with a classic phenotype of MfS, suggesting that conservative substitutions in this region may lead to a less severe phenotype of the disease. This finding further demonstrates the remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity associated with FBN1 mutations and stresses the significance of modifying genes and individual alterations in protein function for the pheontypic expression of the disease."

Both mutations did not alter synthesis and secretion of the polypeptides into the culture medium. Electron microscopy after rotary shadowing and comparison of circular dichroism spectra exhibited minor structural differences between the wild-type and mutated forms. The mutated polypeptides were significantly more susceptible to proteolytic degradation by a variety of proteases as compared with their wild-type counterparts. Most of the sensitive cleavage sites were mapped close to the mutations, indicating local structural changes within the mutated cbEGF modules. Other cleavage sites, however, were observed at distances beyond the domain containing the mutation, suggesting longer range structural effects within tandemly repeated cbEGF modules.

FBN1 at 15q21.1 was found to cause Marfan syndrome in 1991, and in 2004 TGFBR2 at 3p24.1 was newly identified as the Marfan syndrome type II gene. Several studies implied that fibrillin-1 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling are functionally related in extracellular matrix. Identification of TGFBR2 mutations in Marfan syndrome type II provided the direct evidence of the relation in humans.\nRECENT FINDINGS: More than 500 FBN1 mutations have been found in Marfan syndrome, tentative genotype - phenotype correlations have emerged, and mouse models are providing insight into pathogenic mechanisms. TGFBR2 mutations are still limited, however, in 2005 were also reported to cause a new aneurysm syndrome. Functional association between fibrillin-1 and TGF-beta signaling in extracellular matrix has been presented.\nSUMMARY: This review focuses on recent molecular genetics advances in Marfan syndrome and overlapping connective tissue disorders. Mutation spectrum of FBN1 and TGFBR2 in relation to phenotype is presented. Functional relation between fibrillin-1 and TGF-beta signaling is discussed. Future prospects in the study of Marfan syndrome are presented."

These fibers have been shown by biochemical and ultrastructural analysis to be composed of two distinct components, a more abundant amorphous component and a 10-12 nm microfibrillar component, which is located primarily around the periphery of the amorphous component. The protein elastin makes up the highly insoluble amorphous component and is responsible for the elastic properties. Elastin is found throughout the vertebrate kingdom and possesses an unusual chemical composition rich in glycine, proline, and hydrophobic amino acids, consonant with its characteristic physical properties. The 72-kDa biosynthetic precursor, tropoelastin, is secreted into the extracellular space where it becomes highly cross-linked into a rubber-like network through the activity of the copper-requiring enzyme lysyl oxidase. Analysis of the elastin gene has demonstrated that hydrophobic and cross-linking domains are encoded in separate exons and that there is significant alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms of tropoelastin. The elastin gene promoter contains many potential binding sites for various modulating factors indicative of a complex pattern of transcriptional regulation. The microfibrils contain several proteins, including fibrillin, and probably act as an organizing scaffold in the formation of the elastin network. There appears to be a fibrillin gene family in which each protein contains multiple repeats of a motif previously found in epidermal growth factor and a second motif observed in transforming growth factor beta 1-binding protein. Mutations in the fibrillin gene located on human chromosome 15 have been strongly implicated as the cause of the Marfan syndrome."

To date, over 300 beta-thalassemia alleles have been characterized in or around the beta-globin region. Thalassemia major is severe anemia necessitating chronic blood transfusions, splenectomy, iron chelation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation. Usually thalassemia major results from homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for severe betaO- and/or beta+-thalassemia mutations. Thalassemia intermedia is a clinical diagnosis that describes a symptomatic but less severe condition than beta-thalassemia major. beta-thalassemia intermedia may arise from several different combinations of alpha- and/or beta-thalassemia mutations. Heterozygous beta-thalassemia is typically characterized by a mild microcytic hypochromic anemia without any significant clinical implications. In this report, we describe a 63-year-old Africian American woman with asymptomatic homozygous beta-thalassemia, who seems to carry 2 copies of the -29 mutation in the promoter region of the beta-globin gene. Her elevated hemoglobin F level of 83% was associated with heterozygosity for the Xmn I polymorphism upstream of the Ggamma-globin gene. Southern blot analysis at the alpha-globin locus did not show any deletion that would account for the mildness of her phenotype. Therefore, homozygosity for the -29 mutation along with the Xmn I polymorphism appears to confer an extremely mild beta-thalassemia phenotype. This observation has important implications in the prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling of families segregating this type of genetic defect."

Previous studies have demonstrated that endogenous L1 retrotransposition can occur in the germ line and during early embryonic development. In addition, recent data indicate that engineered human L1s can undergo somatic retrotransposition in human neural progenitor cells and that an increase in human-specific L1 DNA content can be detected in the brains of normal controls, as well as in Rett syndrome patients. Here, we demonstrate an increase in the retrotransposition efficiency of engineered human L1s in cells that lack or contain severely reduced levels of ataxia telangiectasia mutated, a serine/threonine kinase involved in DNA damage signaling and neurodegenerative disease. We demonstrate that the increase in L1 retrotransposition in ataxia telangiectasia mutated-deficient cells most likely occurs by conventional target-site primed reverse transcription and generate either longer, or perhaps more, L1 retrotransposition events per cell. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting an increase in human-specific L1 DNA copy number in postmortem brain tissue derived from ataxia telangiectasia patients compared with healthy controls. Together, these data suggest that cellular proteins involved in the DNA damage response may modulate L1 retrotransposition."

Whole-genome sequencing revealed brain-specific L1 insertion in patients localized preferentially to synapse- and schizophrenia-related genes. To study the mechanism of L1 transposition, we examined perinatal environmental risk factors for schizophrenia in animal models and observed an increased L1 copy number after immune activation by poly-I:C or epidermal growth factor.

Scattered throughout mammalian genomes, L1 is typically quiescent in most somatic cell types. In developing neurons, however, L1 can express and retrotranspose at high frequency. The L1 element can insert into various genomic locations including intragenic regions. These insertions can alter the dynamic of the neuronal transcriptome by changing the expression pattern of several nearby genes. The consequences of L1 genomic alterations in somatic cells are still under investigation, but the high level of mutagenesis within neurons suggests that each neuron is genetically unique. Furthermore, some neurological diseases, such as Rett syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia, misregulate L1 retrotransposition, which could contribute to some pathological aspects. In this review, we survey the literature related to neurodevelopmental retrotransposition and discuss possible relevance to neuronal function, evolution, and neurological disease."

Active L1 retrotransposons can impact the genome in a variety of ways, creating insertions, deletions, new splice sites or gene expression fine-tuning. We have shown previously that L1 retrotransposons are capable of mobilization in neuronal progenitor cells from rodents and humans and evidence of massive L1 insertions was observed in adult brain tissues but not in other somatic tissues. In addition, L1 mobility in the adult hippocampus can be influenced by the environment. The neuronal specificity of somatic L1 retrotransposition in neural progenitors is partially due to the transition of a Sox2/HDAC1 repressor complex to a Wnt-mediated T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) transcriptional activator. The transcriptional switch accompanies chromatin remodelling during neuronal differentiation, allowing a transient stimulation of L1 transcription. The activity of L1 retrotransposons during brain development can have an impact on gene expression and neuronal function, thereby increasing brain-specific genetic mosaicism. Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate L1 expression should provide new insights into the role of L1 retrotransposition during brain development. Here we show that L1 neuronal transcription and retrotransposition in rodents are increased in the absence of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a protein involved in global DNA methylation and human neurodevelopmental diseases. Using neuronal progenitor cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells and human tissues, we revealed that patients with Rett syndrome (RTT), carrying MeCP2 mutations, have increased susceptibility for L1 retrotransposition. Our data demonstrate that L1 retrotransposition can be controlled in a tissue-specific manner and that disease-related genetic mutations can influence the frequency of neuronal L1 retrotransposition. Our findings add a new level of complexity to the molecular events that can lead to neurological disorders."

Its etiology includes floppy valve, postinflammatory disease, infective endocarditis, and other disorders. Recently, there has been an increased tendency to remove only portions of the mitral valve, causing difficulty in the determination of etiology. Our objective was to study the pathology and etiology of mitral regurgitation from surgically removed specimens.\nMETHODS: Native mitral valve specimens surgically excised due to mitral insufficiency were examined. Etiology was determined according to macroscopic, microscopic, clinical, and operative findings.\nRESULTS: Among 278 mitral valve specimens, 43% were classified as floppy valve, 31% as postinflammatory disease (presumably associated with rheumatic fever), 12% as infective endocarditis, and 14% as miscellaneous group. In floppy valves, diffuse myxoid change and chordal rupture were the main findings. In postinflammatory disease, moderate neovascularization and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration were most commonly found. Aschoff bodies were found in two cases. In infective endocarditis, gram-positive cocci were found in 70% of cases. In the miscellaneous group, three cases were related to Marfan syndrome and one case was related to papillary muscle necrosis. In comparison with postinflammatory disease, the posterior leaflet in the floppy valve had a significantly longer basal free-edge length, a more frequent chordal rupture, and an higher mean age of patients. Among completely and partially excised specimens with postinflammatory disease, there were no significant differences in microscopic findings.\nCONCLUSION: The three most common etiologies in mitral regurgitation were floppy valve, postinflammatory disease, and infective endocarditis. Macroscopic, microscopic, clinical, and operative findings are important in the evaluation of etiology, especially in partially excised specimens."

Some congenital anomalies such as the 21-trisomy syndrome (Down syndrome) show poorly differentiated immature valves similar to those under development. The normally mature valves have four layers of the connective tissue, i.e., proximalis, spongiosa, fibrosa and distalis. Gargoylism promotes abnormal thickening of collagen fibers in the fibrosa via acid-mucopolysaccharide (aMPS) overproduction, but Marfan syndrome weakens the valves in spite of increased aMPS. The reversed conditions could be caused by the difference of increased aMPS; i.e., dermatan sulfate B or heparitin sulfate in gargoylism, on the contrary, dermatan sulfate A and C or hyaluronic acid in Marfan syndrome. Hemodynamic changes in the valves consist of diffuse hypertrophy of the proximalis and fibrosa in high flow cases and focal thickening of the proximalis at the line of closure and of the spongiosa at the anatomical edge in high pressure cases. Aging of the valves simulates partly the hemodynamic changes but degeneration of collagen fibers in the fibrosa after consumption of the spongiosa is more prominent than the latter. So-called myxomatous degeneration in the mitral valve prolapse cases seems reactive hypertrophy of the spongiosa replacing the interrupted fibrosa. Spontaneous chordal rupture is partly related to myxomatous change, but that in the elderly cases shows only simple disruption of collagen fibers with loss of the spongiosa tissue. Calcification of the valvular rings and bodies often observed in the elderly cases with parallelism to degeneration of the connective tissue produces mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis or both, showing a preponderance of females.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Mitral regurgitation was caused by annulus dilatation in all patients, by leaflet prolapse in five patients, and by chordal rupture due to endocarditis in two. Six patients underwent mitral valve replacement; three of these were operated on using preservation of the mitral valve apparatus. Three patients underwent mitral annuloplasty and chordal shortening.\nRESULTS: There was no hospital mortality, nor any valve-related complications in the series. The postoperative course was uneventful after each operation. At a mean follow up of 4.5 years, all patients were in NYHA class I or II, with improved functional capacity.\nCONCLUSION: This experience in mitral valve procedures indicated that the connective tissue defect might compromise the results of such surgery, but that mitral valve operations could be performed satisfactorily in young Marfan syndrome patients, despite complications of left ventricular dilatation."

Use of nicardipine contained in cardioplegia, continuous infusion of nicardipine and nitroglycerin after aortic declamping completely prevented coronary spasm throughout the course of a second surgery for mitral valve replacement. It is worthy to report this case because of rarities such as Marfan's syndrome accompanied by Prinzmetal's variant angina, perioperative coronary artery spasm in modified Bentall's operation, and perioperative chordal rupture of the mitral valve and progression of mitral valve regurgitation.

Complications are relatively uncommon, but false associations due to ascertainment bias have had a potential for iatrogenic harm. Adverse outcomes which do occur in a subset of MVP subjects are considered here in relation to the contributions of genes, gender and geometry. There are definite associations between MVP and several dominantly inherited connective tissue abnormalities; it occurs in 85% of adults with Marfan syndrome. All these contribute to a very small proportion of the MVP population. A larger less easily characterised group with dominant inheritance and some features of a connective tissue disorder awaits DNA studies for identification. For most MVP subjects our data define significant family aggregation consistent with polygenic inheritance; the likelihood of a first degree relative having MVP is about two and a half times the population average. There is a higher prevalence in young women than in men-5% versus 3%; this has also been demonstrated for floppy mitral valve (MV) at autopsy. MVP complications of chordal rupture, severe mitral regurgitation and infective endocarditis are, however, two to three times more common in men, are age related and evident after the age of 50 years. Higher blood pressure in men may contribute to this in accordance with a response-to-injury hypothesis to explain progressive valve changes.

An Historical Perspective traces the evolution from the now abandoned \"pericardial\" or \"extracardiac\" phases, through the leafletchordal phase (redundancy), the myocardial phase (segmental left ventricular contraction abnormalities), to the anular phase (dilatation and faulty systolic contraction). Functional Anatomy is dealt with in terms of pathology, pathophysiology, hemodynamics, angiocardiography, echocardiography, and physical and pharmacological interventions. Clinical Manifestations are concerned with prevalence, natural history, symptoms, physical signs, electrocardiographic abnormalities and roentgen fingings. The four Major Complications- sudden death, infective endocarditis, spontaneous rupture of chordae tendineae, and progressive mitral regurgitation- are examined. Associated Cardiac Diseases, i.e., Marfan's syndrome, ostium secundum atrial septal defect and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, are discussed, and a section on Treatment deals chiefly with prophylaxis for infective endocarditis and the management of arrhythmias and chest pain. A final section on Evolving Information considers etiologic concepts, the nature of left ventricular contration abnormalities, the cause of chest pain, the relationship to Marfan's syndrome and ostium secundum atrial septal defect, and the effect of aging and sex differences on leaflet chordal redundancy."

The intrinsic limitations of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), including non-linearity, multidimensionality and floor-effect, have emerged and its usefulness argued. The ALS Milano-Torino staging (ALS-MITOS) system was proposed as a novel tool to measure the progression of ALS and overcome these limitations. This study was performed to validate the ALS-MITOS as a 6-month proxy of survival in 200 ALS patients followed up to 18 months.\nMETHODS: Analyses were performed on data from the recombinant human erythropoietin RCT that failed to demonstrate differences between groups for both primary and secondary outcomes. The ALS-MITOS system is composed of four key domains included in the ALSFRS-R scale (walking/self-care, swallowing, communicating and breathing), each with a threshold reflecting the loss of function in the specific ALSFRS-R subscores. Sensitivity, specificity and the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curves of the ALS-MITOS system stages and ALSFRS-R decline at 6 months were calculated and compared with the primary outcome (survival, tracheotomy or >23-hour non-invasive ventilation) at 12 and 18 months Predicted probabilities of the ALS-MITO system at 6 months for any event at 12 and 18 months were computed through logistic regression models.\nRESULTS: Disease progression from baseline to 6 months as defined by the ALS-MITOS system predicted death, tracheotomy or >23-hour non-invasive ventilation at 12 months with 82% sensitivity (95% CI 71% to 93%, n=37/45) and 63% specificity (95% CI 55% to 71%, n=92/146), and at 18 months with 71% sensitivity (95% CI 61% to 82%, n=50/70) and 68% specificity (95% CI 60% to 77%, n=76/111). The analysis of ALS-MITOS and ALSFRS-R progression at 6-month follow-up showed that the best cut-off to predict survival at 12 and 18 months was 1 for the ALS-MITOS (ie, loss of at least one function) and a decline ranging from 6 to 9 points for the ALSFRS-R.\nCONCLUSIONS: The ALS-MITOS system can reliably predict the course of ALS up to 18 months and can be considered a novel and valid outcome measure in RCTs."

We aimed to assess whether lithium improves survival in patients with ALS.\nMETHODS: The lithium carbonate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (LiCALS) trial is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral lithium taken daily for 18 months in patients with ALS. Patients aged at least 18 years who had ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria, had disease duration between 6 and 36 months, and were taking riluzole were recruited from ten centres in the UK. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either lithium or matched placebo tablets. Randomisation was via an online system done at the level of the individual by block randomisation with randomly varying block sizes, stratified by study centre and site of disease onset (limb or bulbar). All patients and assessing study personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the rate of survival at 18 months and was analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with Eudract, number 2008-006891-31.\nFINDINGS: Between May 26, 2009, and Nov 10, 2011, 243 patients were screened, 214 of whom were randomly assigned to receive lithium (107 patients) or placebo (107 patients). Two patients discontinued treatment and one died before the target therapeutic lithium concentration could be achieved. 63 (59%) of 107 patients in the placebo group and 54 (50%) of 107 patients in the lithium group were alive at 18 months. The survival functions did not differ significantly between groups (Mantel-Cox log-rank \u03c7(2) on 1 df=1\u00b764; p=0\u00b720). After adjusting for study centre and site of onset using logistic regression, the relative odds of survival at 18 months (lithium vs placebo) was 0\u00b771 (95% CI 0\u00b740-1\u00b724). 56 patients in the placebo group and 61 in the lithium group had at least one serious adverse event.\nINTERPRETATION: We found no evidence of benefit of lithium on survival in patients with ALS, but nor were there safety concerns, which had been identified in previous studies with less conventional designs. This finding emphasises the importance of pursuing adequately powered trials with clear endpoints when testing new treatments.\nFUNDING: The Motor Neurone Disease Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland."

A critical question is whether these pharmacodynamic properties of lithium translate into neurodegenerative diseases modifying effects in human subjects.\nMETHODS: We reviewed all English controlled clinical trials published in PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, SCOPUS, ISI-Web with the use of lithium for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders between July 2004 and July 2014.\nRESULTS: Lithium showed evidence for positive effects on cognitive functions and biomarkers in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, 1 study) and AD (2 studies), even with doses lower than those used for mood stabilisation. Studies of Li in HD, MSA and CSI did not show benefits of lithium. However, due to methodological limitations and small sample size, these studies may be inconclusive. Studies in ALS showed consistently negative results and presented evidence against the use of lithium for the treatment of this disease.\nCONCLUSION: In absence of disease modifying treatments for any neurodegenerative disorders, the fact that at least 3 studies supported the effect of lithium in aMCI/AD is noteworthy. Future studies should focus on defining the dose range necessary for neuroprotective effects to occur."

Riluzole prolongs survival in ALS. A published report has suggested a dramatic effect of lithium carbonate on survival. 44 patients were studied, with 16 randomly selected to take LiCO3 and riluzole and 28 allocated to take riluzole alone. In the group treated with lithium, no patients had died (i.e., 100% survival) at the end of the study (15 months from entry), compared to 71% surviving in the riluzole-only group. Although the trial can be criticised on several grounds, there is a substantial rationale from other laboratory studies that lithium is worth investigating therapeutically in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\nMETHODS/DESIGN: LiCALS is a multi-centre double-blind randomised parallel group controlled trial of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lithium carbonate (LiCO3) at doses to achieve stable 'therapeutic' plasma levels (0.4-0.8 mmol/L), plus standard treatment, versus matched placebo plus standard treatment, in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The study will be based in the UK, in partnership with the MND Association and DeNDRoN (the Dementias and Neurodegnerative Diseases Clinical Research Network). 220 patients will be recruited. All patients will be on the standard treatment for ALS of riluzole 100 mg daily. The primary outcome measure will be death from any cause at 18 months defined from the date of randomisation. Secondary outcome measures will be changes in three functional rating scales, the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised, The EuroQOL (EQ-5D), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.Eligible patients will have El Escorial Possible, Laboratory-supported Probable, Probable or Definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with disease duration between 6 months and 36 months (inclusive), vital capacity \u2265 60% of predicted within 1 month prior to randomisation and age at least18 years.\nDISCUSSION: Patient recruitment began in June 2009 and the last patient is expected to complete the trial protocol in November 2011.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Current controlled trials ISRCTN83178718."

In terms of disease-modifying treatment options, several drugs such as dexpramipexole, pioglitazone, lithium, and many others have been tested in large multicenter trials, albeit with disappointing results. Therefore, riluzole remains the only directly disease-modifying drug. In addition, we discuss antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) as a new and potentially causal treatment option. Progress in symptomatic treatments has been more important. Nutrition and ventilation are now an important focus of ALS therapy. Several studies have firmly established that noninvasive ventilation improves patients' quality of life and prolongs survival. On the other hand, there is still no consensus regarding best nutritional management, but big multicenter trials addressing this issue are currently ongoing. Evidence regarding secondary symptoms like spasticity, muscle cramps or sialorrhea remains generally scarce, but some new insights will also be discussed. Growing evidence suggests that multidisciplinary care in specialized clinics improves survival."

The primary endpoint was survival, defined as death, tracheostomal ventilation or non-invasive ventilation for more than 16 h/day.

The neuroprotective effects of lithium in this indication tend to be well known and are mediated by its action on two enzymes: glycogen synthase kinase-3 and inositol monophosphatase-1. Preclinical and clinical studies seek to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of lithium in neurodegenerative disorders. The aims of this literature review is to gather clinical studies that investigated the efficacy of lithium in neurodegenerative diseases, using a systematic method based on PubMed data. Results were found concerning Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spino-cerebellar ataxia. Lithium exposure showed a potential neuroprotective effect in studies on psychiatric populations with a lower prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in exposed patients. In patients with mild cognitive impairment, lithium would be associated with clinical improvement and a lower level of cerebrospinal phosphorylated tau protein. Lithium would allow at least a partial improvement in symptoms, including suicidal thoughts, in Huntington's disease. Despite several positive case reports and short studies, further controlled researches have failed to substantiate any positive effects of lithium exposure in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In spinocerebellar ataxia, introduction of lithium may be of benefits in terms of improvement of cerebellar symptoms. Large randomized controlled trials are required to asses the effect of early exposure lithium in these indications, based on reliable biological markers of disease."

This clinical study was published in addition with basic (in vitro) and pre-clinical (in vivo) data demonstrating a defect of autophagy as a final common pathway in the genesis of ALS. In fact, lithium was used as an autophagy inducer. In detailing the protective effects of lithium we found for the first time that this drug stimulates the biogenesis of mitochondria in the central nervous system and, uniquely in the spinal cord, it induces neuronogenesis and neuronal differentiation. In particular, the effects induced by lithium can be summarized as follows: (i) the removal of altered mitochondria and protein aggregates; (ii) the biogenesis of well-structured mitochondria; (iii) the suppression of glial proliferation; (iv) the differentiation of newly formed neurons in the spinal cord towards a specific phenotype. In this addendum we focus on defective autophagy as a \"leit motif\" in ALS and the old and novel features of lithium which bridge autophagy activation to concomitant effects that may be useful for the treatment of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the biogenesis of mitochondria and the increase of calbindin D 28K-positive neurons, which are likely to support powerful neuroprotection towards autophagy failure, mitochondriopathy and neuronal loss in the spinal cord."

In the present study, we found that daily doses of lithium, leading to plasma levels ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 mEq/liter, delay disease progression in human patients affected by ALS. None of the patients treated with lithium died during the 15 months of the follow-up, and disease progression was markedly attenuated when compared with age-, disease duration-, and sex-matched control patients treated with riluzole for the same amount of time. In a parallel study on a genetic ALS animal model, the G93A mouse, we found a marked neuroprotection by lithium, which delayed disease onset and duration and augmented the life span. These effects were concomitant with activation of autophagy and an increase in the number of the mitochondria in motor neurons and suppressed reactive astrogliosis. Again, lithium reduced the slow necrosis characterized by mitochondrial vacuolization and increased the number of neurons counted in lamina VII that were severely affected in saline-treated G93A mice. After lithium administration in G93A mice, the number of these neurons was higher even when compared with saline-treated WT. All these mechanisms may contribute to the effects of lithium, and these results offer a promising perspective for the treatment of human patients affected by ALS."

We performed a multicenter trial with lithium carbonate to assess its tolerability, safety, and efficacy in patients with ALS, comparing 2 different target blood levels (0.4-0.8 mEq/L, therapeutic group [TG], vs 0.2-0.4 mEq/L, subtherapeutic group [STG]).\nMETHODS: The study was a multicenter, single-blind, randomized, dose-finding trial, conducted from May 2008 to November 2009 in 21 Italian ALS centers. The trial was registered with the public database of the Italian Agency for Drugs (http://oss-sper-clin.agenziafarmaco.it/) (EudraCT number 2008-001094-15).\nRESULTS: As of October 2009, a total of 171 patients had been enrolled, 87 randomized to the TG and 84 to the STG. The interim data analysis, performed per protocol, showed that 117 patients (68.4%) discontinued the study because of death/tracheotomy/severe disability, adverse events (AEs)/serious AEs (SAEs), or lack of efficacy. The Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping the trial on November 2, 2009.\nCONCLUSIONS: Lithium was not well-tolerated in this cohort of patients with ALS, even at subtherapeutic doses. The 2 doses were equivalent in terms of survival/severe disability and functional data. The relatively high frequency of AEs/SAEs and the reduced tolerability of lithium raised serious doubts about its safety in ALS.\nCLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: The study provides Class II evidence that therapeutic (0.4-0.8 mEq/L) vs subtherapeutic (0.2-0.4 mEq/L) lithium carbonate did not differ in the primary outcome of efficacy (survival/loss of autonomy) in ALS. Both target levels led to dropouts in more than 30% of participants due to patient-perceived lack of efficacy and AEs."

The excellent results of this pilot study engendered considerable optimism among patients, their families, patients' associations, and the scientific community. This report sparked numerous phase ii clinical trials. Many patients who were not included in these studies used all resources at their disposal to access the drug as treatment under a compassionate use programme.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of lithium in ALS using a meta-analysis of the information reported in 12 studies which were examined for methodological quality.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: . Searches were performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and EudraCT (January 1996-August 2012).\nRESULTS: To date, we have information on more 1100 patients treated with lithium. Unfortunately, the results do not confirm the positive effect described in the pilot study, which suggests that this drug is not effective at slowing disease progression. Two trials had to be suspended before the scheduled completion date due to the ineffectiveness of the drug as well as numerous adverse effects. A recently published study also ruled out any possible modest effect.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to suggest that lithium has no short-term benefits in ALS. A comparison of the group of patients treated with lithium+riluzole and the control group treated with riluzole alone showed no statistically significant differences in rates of functional decline, deterioration of respiratory function, or survival time. Furthermore, there was no evidence that it was more effective than the placebo."

We matched clinical data with data regarding the UNC13A and C9orf72 genotype. Our primary outcome was survival at 12 months. On an exploratory basis, we assessed whether the effect of lithium depended on the genotype.\nRESULTS: Clinical data were available for 518 of the 606 participants. Overall, treatment with lithium carbonate did not improve 12-month survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7-1.4; p = 0.96). Both the UNC13A and C9orf72 genotype were independent predictors of survival (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.3; p = 0.006 and HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.2; p = 0.032, respectively). The effect of lithium was different for UNC13A carriers (p = 0.027), but not for C9orf72 carriers (p = 0.22).

Our results suggest that we should reorient our strategies toward finding treatments for ALS, start focusing on genotype-targeted treatments, and standardize genotyping in order to optimize randomization and analysis for future clinical trials."

Tumorigenesis in VHL of both RCC and CNS HB occurs secondary to downstream effects of a mutated or absent VHL protein. Treatment of RCCs with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as Pazopanib is now first line therapy, but their effect on VHL-associated CNS HBs remains unknown. We report the use of Pazopanib in a patient with VHL disease for treatment of RCC who also harbored multiple CNS HBs. Following initiation of treatment, a large cervical and a lumbar spinal HB regressed in size while the remaining CNS HBs exhibited stable or progressive disease. These findings highlight the multiplicity of factors contributing to hemangioblastoma development, even among tumors with a common germline mutation, and the potential limitations of TKIs, but additionally this report supports the conservative management of asymptomatic VHL patients with spinal HBs whereby tumor response to TKI treatment may alleviate or postpone the need for surgery."

We aimed to assess the activity and safety of pazopanib in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease.\nMETHODS: In this non-randomised, single-centre, open-label, phase 2 trial, adult patients with clinical manifestations of von Hippel-Lindau disease were recruited from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA) and were treated with pazopanib (800 mg orally daily) for 24 weeks, with an option to continue treatment if desired by the patient and treating physician. Primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response and safety in the per-protocol population. The objective response was measured for each patient and each lesion type. Radiographic assessments were done at baseline and every 12 weeks throughout the study. Activity and safety were assessed with continuous monitoring and a Bayesian design. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01436227, and is closed to accrual.\nFINDINGS: Between Jan 18, 2012, and Aug 10, 2016, we screened 37 patients with genetically confirmed or clinical features consistent with von Hippel-Lindau disease, of whom 31 eligible patients were treated with pazopanib. The proportion of patients who achieved an objective response was 42% (13 of 31 patients). By lesion sites responses were observed in 31 (52%) of 59 renal cell carcinomas, nine (53%) of 17 pancreatic lesions, and two (4%) of 49 CNS haemangioblastomas. Seven (23%) of 31 patients chose to stay on the treatment after 24 weeks. Four (13%) of 31 patients withdrew from the study because of grade 3 or 4 transaminitis, and three (10%) discontinued study treatment because of treatment intolerance with multiple intercurrent grade 1-2 toxicities. Treatment-related serious adverse events included one case each of appendicitis and gastritis and one patient had a fatal CNS bleed.\nINTERPRETATION: Pazopanib was associated with encouraging preliminary activity in von Hippel-Lindau disease, with a side-effect profile consistent with that seen in previous trials. Pazopanib could be considered as a treatment choice for patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease and growing lesions, or to reduce the size of unresectable lesions in these patients. The safety and activity of pazopanib in this setting warrants further investigation.\nFUNDING: Novartis Inc and NIH National Cancer Institute core grant."

With mean age at diagnosis of 30 years, CNS hemangioblastomas are usually the first manifestation of the disease. Ongoing clinical and radiological surveillance is required, with symptomatic lesions necessitating treatment. As tumor growth is inevitable during the lifetime of most VHL patients, and the multiplicity of tumors may preclude surgical cure, the search for effective therapies is ongoing. Here we provide the first report demonstrating clinical and radiological anti-tumor response using pazopanib, a small molecule multi-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in a patient with treatment-refractory VHL-associated CNS hemangioblastoma.

Adapted from studies in twitcher mice, GLD dogs were treated by combination intravenous and intracerebroventricular injections of AAVrh10 to target both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Combination of intravenous and intracerebroventricular AAV gene therapy had a clear dose response and resulted in delayed onset of clinical signs, extended life-span, correction of biochemical defects, and attenuation of neuropathology.

We found the late-onset form of KD present in 82% of the patients in our study, which was more prevalent than in patients from other populations. Plasma psychosine levels were elevated in KD, which were correlated with the severity of clinical presentations. Sanger sequencing identified 8 novel mutations, including 7 missense mutations, p.H253Y, p.S259L, p.P318L, p.F350V, p.T428A, p.L530P, p.G586D, and 1 splicing mutation, c.1251+1G>A. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification identified a novel exon 12 and 14 deletion, separately. Next generation sequencing, applied at the final step, revealed 2 missense mutant alleles missed using Sanger sequencing. The most common mutation in Chinese population is p.P154H, which accounts for 20.5% of alleles. Consistent with the higher prevalence of the late-onset form of KD, missense mutations predominated in our study, different with the common mutation types in Europe and Japan. This work was the first large-scale study of Chinese KD patients describing their clinical, biochemical and genetic characteristics, which furthered our understanding of this classical neurological lysosomal storage disease."

Patients with the infantile form of Krabbe disease can be treated at a presymptomatic stage with human stem cell transplantation which improves survival and clinical outcomes. However, without a family history, most cases of infantile Krabbe disease present after onset of symptoms and are ineligible for transplantation. In 2006, New York began screening newborns for Krabbe disease to identify presymptomatic cases. To ensure that those identified with infantile disease received timely treatment, New York public health and medical systems took steps to accurately diagnose and rapidly refer infants for human stem cell transplantation within the first few weeks of life. After 11\u00a0years of active screening in New York and the introduction of Krabbe disease newborn screening in other states, new information has been gained which can inform the design of newborn screening programs to improve infantile Krabbe disease outcomes.\nFINDINGS: Recent information relevant to Krabbe disease screening, diagnosis, and treatment were assessed by a diverse group of public health, medical, and advocacy professionals. Outcomes after newborn screening may improve if treatment for infantile disease is initiated before 30\u00a0days of life. Newer laboratory screening and diagnostic tools can improve the speed and specificity of diagnosis and help facilitate this early referral. Given the rarity of Krabbe disease, most recommendations were based on case series or expert opinion.\nCONCLUSION: This report updates recommendations for Krabbe disease newborn screening to improve the timeliness of diagnosis and treatment of infantile Krabbe disease. In the United States, several states have begun or are considering Krabbe disease newborn screening. These recommendations can guide public health laboratories on methodologies for screening and inform clinicians about the need to promptly diagnose and treat infantile Krabbe disease. The timing of the initial referral after newborn screening, the speed of diagnostic confirmation of infantile disease, and the transplantation center's experience and ability to rapidly respond to a suspected patient with newly diagnosed infantile Krabbe disease are critical for optimal outcomes."

She was referred to Daisan Hospital of the Jikei University School of Medicine on April 1, 1991 for refractory thrombocytopenia. She had shown sensorineural hearing loss since the age of 6 years and her peripheral blood smear revealed giant platelets on admission. She was treated with interferon, prednisolone, and high-dose gamma-globulin (400 mg/day x 5 days). However, the platelet count did not increase, but hypermenorrhea continued. She subsequently showed proteinuria and hematuria. She underwent splenectomy and renal biopsy on August 12, 1992. The glomeruli appeared to be almost normal under light microscopy. The interstitium showed regional fibrosis containing foam cells and the renal tubuli showed mild atrophy. Under electronmicroscopy, the basement membrane of the glomeruli was associated with mesangial interposition and the lamina densa was split into several layers.

Classical AS is a progressive renal disease presenting with a triad of progressive hematuric nephritis and typical extra-renal complications, such as sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and variable ocular anomalies. The mode of inheritance in AS is X-linked in 85%, autosomal recessive in 15%, and autosomal dominant in rare cases.\nOBJECTIVES: This study aims to identify underlying mutation in multiple individuals from a large consanguineous Saudi family with inherited nephropathy, including our index patient who manifested all the features of classical AS.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were diagnosed by nephrologists and clinical geneticists. All the individuals underwent clinical, audiological and ophthalmological evaluation. Blood samples were collected after written informed consent. DNA extraction, homozygosity mapping and PCR amplification followed standard methodologies.\nRESULTS: The disease locus was mapped to 2q36.3, where both COL4A3 and COL4A4 reside. Sanger sequencing of COL4A3 and COL4A4 revealed an underlying novel homozygous disease-causing COL4A4 mutation (c.2420delG; p.G807fsX60) in the affected proband. Considerable phenotypic variability segregating with this COL4A4 mutation in our study family is documented. The homozygous mutants were manifesting end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in their adolescence, while the heterozygous carrier members were presenting with considerable phenotypic heterogeneity ranging from intermittent hematuria to late onset ESRD. In addition, there is a relatively severe involvement of the ear (SNHL) and eye in the homozygotes than the heterozygotes. Fertility problems were also noted in both of the homozygous females.\nCONCLUSION: Identification of the causative mutation is an efficient strategy for conclusive molecular diagnosis in the patients and to establish genotype/phenotype correlation. It is important to study and evaluate asymptomatic carriers, to predict prognosis of the disease and to obviate the need for another renal biopsy in at-risk related family members. While an accurate genetic diagnosis of AS provides valuable information for genetic counseling in the extended family members, it can also facilitate future prenatal diagnosis and planning for pre-implantation genetic diagnosis."

New signs have been described which can be useful both for diagnosis and for prognosticating the risk of complications. This study examines and describes a triad comprising the unusual 'stair-case' foveal sign, together with choroidal thinning and late-stage peripheral schisis in a patient with Alport syndrome.\nCASE PRESENTATION: This is a case report of a 49-year-old Caucasian male with a background of X-linked Alport syndrome presenting with gradual and progressive diminution of vision in the left eye with a central blur. He had already undergone three renal allografts, was deaf and suffered from hypertension by the time of his first presentation to ophthalmology. On examination, corrected visual acuity was 6/9.5 in the right eye and 6/30 in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography imaging showed an unusual 'stair-case' sign of the fovea in both eyes, together with choroidal thinning. We postulate that an abnormal vitreomacular interface followed by vitreomacular traction and eventually separation, removing layers of the inner retina with the vitreous, led to this unusual appearance. Subsequently, this patient also developed schitic changes more peripherally in the retina which progressed over the following 5\u2009years.\nCONCLUSION: The stair-case foveal sign, choroidal thinning and mid-peripheral schisis are three signs that clinicians might expect to encounter on optical coherence tomography imaging of patients with Alport syndrome. These findings can be attributed to unique mutations of collagen IV which lead to a variety of clinical phenotypes affecting basement membrane structures. Identification of these features may not only be useful diagnostically and in forecasting complications such as macular holes, but also predict mode of inheritance and likelihood of early-onset renal failure."

The patient exhibited bilateral full-thickness macular holes measuring >1500\u2009\u00b5m at their smallest diameters. The very large dimensions of both macular holes were indicative of a bad prognosis regarding hole closure, and a conservative approach was adopted. The patient was maintained on renal substitution therapy, and genetic counseling was offered to other family members.\nCONCLUSION:: Ophthalmological findings associated to Alport syndrome commonly include anterior lenticonus and dot-and-fleck retinopathy, although giant macular holes can also be associated with this condition.

Alport first published his description of a triad of symptoms in a family with hereditary congenital haemorrhagic nephritis, deafness and ocular changes.

During the past two decades, research into this rare disease has focused on the effects of mutations in collagen type IV and the role of changes in podocytes and the glomerular basement membrane that lead to early kidney fibrosis. Animal models of Alport syndrome also demonstrate the pathogenetic importance of interactions between podocytes and the extracellular matrix. Such models might also help researchers to answer basic questions about podocyte function and the development of fibrosis, and to develop new therapeutic approaches that might be of use in other kidney diseases. In this Review, we discuss the latest basic and clinical research on Alport syndrome, focusing on the roles of podocyte pathology and the extracellular matrix.

Four hundred patients with probable or definite ALS and vital capacity less than 100% were randomly assigned to treatment with placebo or 1.2 g pentoxifylline daily. The primary outcome was death. Secondary outcomes were rates of deterioration of ALS Functional Rating Scale-Respiratory and muscle strength. The primary intention-to-treat analysis was the survival comparison of drug vs placebo, assessed before (log-rank test) and after adjustment (Cox model) for predefined prognostic factors.\nRESULTS: At the end of the study, after 547 days of follow-up, 103 patients (51.7%) in the pentoxifylline group and 120 (59.7%) in the placebo group were alive (unadjusted risk 1.28, p = 0.107; adjusted risk 1.43, p = 0.02). In contrast, analysis of secondary outcome functional variables did not show the same negative effect of the drug. The most common adverse reactions were nausea, dysphagia, and flushing, all reversible after stopping the drug.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pentoxifylline is not beneficial in ALS and should be avoided in patients treated with riluzole. The discrepancy between survival and measures of functional changes urges caution in equating these end points in phase III trials, and suggests that both survival and function should be used in phase III trials."

Several trials are planned or are in progress to assess whether minocycline slows human neurodegeneration. We aimed to test the efficacy of minocycline as a treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\nMETHODS: We did a multicentre, randomised placebo-controlled phase III trial. After a 4-month lead-in phase, 412 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or minocycline in escalating doses of up to 400 mg/day for 9 months. The primary outcome measure was the difference in rate of change in the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R). Secondary outcome measures were forced vital capacity (FVC), manual muscle testing (MMT), quality of life, survival, and safety. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00047723.\nFINDINGS: ALSFRS-R score deterioration was faster in the minocycline group than in the placebo group (-1.30 vs -1.04 units/month, 95% CI for difference -0.44 to -0.08; p=0.005). Patients on minocycline also had non-significant tendencies towards faster decline in FVC (-3.48 vs -3.01, -1.03 to 0.11; p=0.11) and MMT score (-0.30 vs -0.26, -0.08 to 0.01; p=0.11), and greater mortality during the 9-month treatment phase (hazard ratio=1.32, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.10; p=0.23) than did patients on placebo. Quality-of-life scores did not differ between the treatment groups. Non-serious gastrointestinal and neurological adverse events were more common in the minocycline group than in the placebo group, but these events were not significantly related to the decline in ALSFRS-R score.\nINTERPRETATION: Our finding that minocycline has a harmful effect on patients with ALS has implications for trials of minocycline in patients with other neurological disorders, and for how potential neuroprotective agents are screened for use in patients with ALS."

It reduces apoptosis in mouse models of Huntington's disease and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and is in clinical trial for sporadic ALS. Because apoptosis also occurs after brain and spinal cord (SCI) injury, its prevention may be useful in improving recovery. We analyzed minocycline's neuroprotective effects over 28 days following contusion SCI and found significant functional recovery compared to tetracycline. Histology, immunocytochemistry, and image analysis indicated statistically significant tissue sparing, reduced apoptosis and microgliosis, and less activated caspase-3 and substrate cleavage. Since our original report in abstract form, others have published both positive and negative effects of minocycline in various rodent models of SCI and with various routes of administration. We have since found decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha, as well as caspase-3 mRNA expression, as possible mechanisms of action for minocycline's ameliorative action. These results support reports that modulating apoptosis, caspases, and microglia provide promising therapeutic targets for prevention and/or limiting the degree of functional loss after CNS trauma. Minocycline, and more potent chemically synthesized tetracyclines, may find a place in the therapeutic arsenal to promote recovery early after SCI in humans."

                    "article": "A recent publication of the results of a clinical trial of minocycline in 412 ALS patient has aroused considerable controversy in the ALS scientific community. As on previous occasions, the results obtained in the laboratory are not reproduced in clinical practice. The reasons for this new disappointment in translational medicine are analysed by applying the successes obtained in the experimental animal model for ALS to humans. The most frequently suggested causes for explaining these continuous failures are unawareness of the correct dosage to be used, the ideal duration of the clinical trial in phase III, sample size, the search for a primary outcome for measurement other than survival, the need for biomarkers giving information on the progression of the disease and whether this is modified by the introduction of the drug for study. Debate focuses on whether the transgenic mouse model of ALS which expresses SOD1 mutations which we have been using for more than a decade is an exact reflection of the clinical profile and the physiopathogenic mechanisms present in patients with spo- radic ALS. There is the possibility that depending on the dose administered, minocycline can be a neuroprotector or a neurotoxin. In other words, at a dose of 200 mg/day, this drug behaves like <<Dr. Jekyll>> and like <<Mr. Hyde>> at doses of 400 mg. For the authors of the trial, this possibility does not seem to be the cause of the disappointing results obtained. However, they acknowledge that one of the limitations of their study was that it was impossible to compare the effects of minocycline in the patient after receiving 200 or 400 mg. For many other researchers running ongoing clinical trials in both ALS and other neurological diseases, the dose of 200 mg/day is chosen as ideal for testing the effectiveness of minocycline in patients. The strategy of administering the maximum dose of a drug to be tested may give rise to misleading results. We agree with the opinion of other authors, who say that minocycline should be given a second chance."

They commonly affect people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) at all stages of the disease. To date, the treatment of muscle cramps in ALS has been largely empirical without any evidence from randomised controlled trials.\nOBJECTIVES: To systematically assess the effect of interventions on muscle cramps as a primary or secondary endpoint or adverse event in people with ALS/MND.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (14 February 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2011 in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2011) and EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2011) and reference lists of articles searched using the terms motor neuron disease, motor neurone disease, motoneuron disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We contacted authors of trials for further information.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised and quasi-randomised trials of oral medications in people with ALS which assessed cramps as a primary or secondary outcome measure or as an adverse event. We also included trials using subcutaneous or intravenous medications or physical therapy.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: All authors applied the selection criteria and assessed study quality independently, and all authors performed independent data extraction.\nMAIN RESULTS: Twenty studies including 4789 participants were identified. Only one trial, of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), assessed cramps as the primary endpoint. Thirteen studies assessed cramps as a secondary endpoint. The medications comprised vitamin E, baclofen, riluzole, L-threonine, xaliproden, indinavir, and memantine. Six studies assessed cramps as an adverse event. The medications comprised creatine, gabapentin, dextromethorphan, quinidine, and lithium. In all 20 studies no favourable effect for the treatment of cramps in ALS/MND could be demonstrated, but many studies were underpowered to draw a definite conclusion. A meta-analysis of two small studies showed a statistically nonsignificant result for the amino acid L-threonine for the treatment of cramps in ALS/MND. No study was identified using physical therapy as a therapeutic intervention for cramps.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to support the use of any intervention for muscle cramps in ALS/MND. More and larger randomised controlled trials evaluating treatments for muscle cramps in ALS/MND are needed."

We carried out two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, multi-national studies with xaliproden (a drug with neurotrophic effect) to assess drug efficacy and safety at two doses. Patients with clinically probable or definite ALS of more than 6 months and less than 5 years duration were randomly assigned to placebo, 1 mg or 2 mg xaliproden orally once daily as monotherapy in Study 1 (n=867); or to the same regimen with addition of riluzole 50 mg bid background therapy in Study 2 (n=1210 patients). The two primary endpoints were defined as: 1. Time to death, tracheostomy, or permanent assisted ventilation (DTP), and 2. Time to vital capacity (VC)<50% or DTP before (log-rank test) and after adjustment using a Cox proportional hazard model for prespecified prognostic factors. Secondary endpoints were rates of change of various functional measures. In Study 1, primary outcome measures did not reach statistical significance. For the 2 mg group, for time to VC<50% analysis (without DTP) a significant 30% RRR was obtained (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.46, P=0.009). In Study 2, no significant results were obtained. However, there was a trend in favour of add-on 1 mg dose xaliproden vs. placebo (RRR 15% [-6.31, ns] for time to VC<50%; RRR 12% [CI: -6.27, ns] for time to VC<50% or DTP). Adjusted RR ratios were consistently more favourable for the xaliproden groups. Tolerability was good, and dose-dependent side effects were largely associated with the serotonergic properties of xaliproden. An effect of xaliproden on functional parameters, especially VC, was noted. Although this effect did not reach statistical significance, xaliproden had a small effect on clinically noteworthy aspects of disease progression in ALS."

We assessed the methodological quality of the included reviews using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool and the GRADE approach. We followed standard Cochrane study (review) selection and data extraction procedures. We reported findings narratively and in tables.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included nine Cochrane Systematic Reviews of interventions to treat symptoms in people with MND. Three were empty reviews with no included randomised controlled trials (RCTs); however, all three reported on non-RCT evidence and the remaining six included mostly one or two studies. We deemed all of the included reviews of high methodological quality. Drug therapy for painThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review exploring the efficacy of drug therapy for pain in MND. Treatment for crampsThere is evidence (13 RCTs, N = 4012) that for the treatment of cramps in MND, compared to placebo:- memantine and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are probably ineffective (moderate-quality evidence);- vitamin E may have little or no effect (low-quality evidence); and- the effects of L-threonine, gabapentin, xaliproden, riluzole, and baclofen are uncertain as the evidence is either very low quality or the trial specified the outcome but did not report numerical data.The review reported adverse effects of riluzole, but it is not clear whether other interventions had adverse effects. Treatment for spasticityIt is uncertain whether an endurance-based exercise programme improved spasticity or quality of life, measured at three months after the programme, as the quality of evidence is very low (1 RCT, comparison \"usual activities\", N = 25). The review did not evaluate other approaches, such as use of baclofen as no RCTs were available. Mechanical ventilation for supporting respiratory functionNon-invasive ventilation (NIV) probably improves median survival and quality of life in people with respiratory insufficiency and normal to moderately impaired bulbar function compared to standard care, and improves quality of life but not survival for people with poor bulbar function (1 RCT, N = 41, moderate-quality evidence; a second RCT did not provide data). The review did not evaluate other approaches such as tracheostomy-assisted ('invasive') ventilation, or assess timing of NIV initiation. Treatment for sialorrhoeaA single session of botulinum toxin type B injections to parotid and submandibular glands probably improves sialorrhoea and quality of life at up to 4 weeks compared to placebo injections, but not at 8 or 12 weeks after the injections (moderate-quality evidence from 1 placebo-controlled RCT, N = 20). The review authors found no trials of other approaches. Enteral tube feeding for supporting nutritionThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to support benefit or harms of enteral tube feeding in supporting nutrition in MND. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulationIt is uncertain whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) improves disability or limitation in activity in MND in comparison with sham rTMS (3 RCTs, very low quality evidence, N = 50). Therapeutic exerciseThere is evidence that exercise may improve disability in MND at three months after the exercise programme, but not quality of life, in comparison with \"usual activities\" or \"usual care\" including stretching (2 RCTs, low-quality evidence, N = 43). Multidisciplinary careThere is no RCT evidence in a Cochrane Systematic Review to demonstrate any benefit or harm for multidisciplinary care in MND.None of the reviews, other than the review of treatment for cramps, reported that adverse events occurred. However, the trials were too small for reliable adverse event reporting.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This overview has highlighted the lack of robust evidence in Cochrane Systematic Reviews on interventions to manage symptoms resulting from MND. It is important to recognise that clinical trials may fail to demonstrate efficacy of an intervention for reasons other than a true lack of efficacy, for example because of insufficient statistical power, the wrong choice of dose, insensitive outcome measures or inappropriate participant eligibility. The trials were mostly too small to reliably assess adverse effects of the treatments. The nature of MND makes it difficult to research clinically accepted or recommended practice, regardless of the level of evidence supporting the practice. It would not be ethical, for example, to design a placebo-controlled trial for treatment of pain in MND or to withhold multidisciplinary care where such care is available. It is therefore highly unlikely that there will ever be classically designed placebo-controlled RCTs in these areas.We need more research with appropriate study designs, robust methodology, and of sufficient duration to address the changing needs-of people with MND and their caregivers-associated with MND disease progression and mortality. There is a significant gap in studies assessing the effectiveness of interventions for symptoms relating to MND, such as pseudobulbar emotional lability and cognitive and behavioural difficulties. Future studies should use appropriate outcome measures that are reliable, have internal and external validity, and are sensitive to change in what is being measured (such as quality of life)."

We report the safety and functional efficacy results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study of xaliproden, a non-peptidic compound with growth factor activities, in 54 ALS patients treated for up to 32 weeks. In order to overcome the interference of mortality with functional assessment in exploratory studies, we identified from our ALS database prognostic factors to establish a staging process for selection pf patients: age, disease duration, slopes of deterioration of the functional scores calculated during the two months prior to the inclusion, and the value at entry of the forced vital capacity (FVC). The six months intent-to-treat analysis showed no statistically significant effect but a trend in favour of 2 mg xaliproden compared to placebo for reduction in the rate of deterioration of FVC, limbs functional score, and manual muscle testing score (MMT). The results in the completer analysis showed a significant 43% slower rate of deterioration in FVC (P=0.046) in xaliproden-treated patients but not in functional and MMT scores. These results support the use of a staging process to select suitable patients for phase II studies, and suggest that xaliproden may have potential effects in ALS and deserve further study."

The combinations of minocycline-creatine and celecoxib-creatine have additive effects in the murine model. New trial designs are needed to efficiently screen the growing number of potential neuroprotective agents. Our objective was to assess two drug combinations in ALS using a novel phase II trial design. We conducted a randomized, double-blind selection trial in sequential pools of 60 patients. Participants received minocycline (100 mg)-creatine (10 g) twice daily or celecoxib (400 mg)-creatine (10 g) twice daily for six months. The primary objective was treatment selection based on which combination best slowed deterioration in the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R); the trial could be stopped after one pool if the difference between the two arms was adequately large. At trial conclusion, each arm was compared to a historical control group in a futility analysis. Safety measures were also examined. After the first patient pool, the mean six-month decline in ALSFRS-R was 5.27 (SD=5.54) in the celecoxib-creatine group and 6.47 (SD=9.14) in the minocycline-creatine group. The corresponding decline was 5.82 (SD=6.77) in the historical controls. The difference between the two sample means exceeded the stopping criterion. The null hypothesis of superiority was not rejected in the futility analysis. Skin rash occurred more frequently in the celecoxib-creatine group. In conclusion, the celecoxib-creatine combination was selected as preferable to the minocycline-creatine combination for further evaluation. This phase II design was efficient, leading to treatment selection after just 60 patients, and can be used in other phase II trials to assess different agents."

Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of ozanezumab in patients with ALS.\nMETHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial was done in 34 centres in 11 countries. Patients aged 18-80 years with a diagnosis of familial or sporadic ALS were randomly assigned (1:1), centrally according to a computer-generated allocation schedule, to receive ozanezumab (15 mg/kg) or placebo as intravenous infusions over 1 h every 2 weeks for 46 weeks, followed by assessments at week 48 and week 60.

The efficacy and safety of a combination of the two compounds in persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are not known.\nMETHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, we enrolled participants with definite ALS who had had an onset of symptoms within the previous 18 months. Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive sodium phenylbutyrate-taurursodiol (3 g of sodium phenylbutyrate and 1 g of taurursodiol, administered once a day for 3 weeks and then twice a day) or placebo. The primary outcome was the rate of decline in the total score on the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R; range, 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating better function) through 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes were the rates of decline in isometric muscle strength, plasma phosphorylated axonal neurofilament H subunit levels, and the slow vital capacity; the time to death, tracheostomy, or permanent ventilation; and the time to death, tracheostomy, permanent ventilation, or hospitalization.\nRESULTS: A total of 177 persons with ALS were screened for eligibility, and 137 were randomly assigned to receive sodium phenylbutyrate-taurursodiol (89 participants) or placebo (48 participants). In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, the mean rate of change in the ALSFRS-R score was -1.24 points per month with the active drug and -1.66 points per month with placebo (difference, 0.42 points per month; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.81; P\u2009=\u20090.03). Secondary outcomes did not differ significantly between the two groups. Adverse events with the active drug were mainly gastrointestinal.\nCONCLUSIONS: Sodium phenylbutyrate-taurursodiol resulted in slower functional decline than placebo as measured by the ALSFRS-R score over a period of 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes were not significantly different between the two groups.

Trials of perampanel in epilepsy showed a favorable tolerability profile. In this study we aimed to determine the tolerability and safety of perampanel in patients with ALS.\nMETHODS: Enrolled subjects were started on 2\u00a0mg/day of perampanel and the dose was increased by 2\u00a0mg/day every week to a maximum dose of 8\u00a0mg/day. Our primary outcome measure was tolerability, which was evaluated by monitoring adverse events. The secondary outcome measure was clinical progression, assessed using the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) and spirometry.\nRESULTS: Six participants were enrolled. All had adverse events, mostly behavioral. Two completed the trial and the other four withdrew due to adverse events.

In this study we report correlations between standardised measures of intelligence and mutational class, mutation size, mutation location and the involvement of dystrophin isoforms.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty two male subjects were recruited as part of a study of the cognitive spectrum in boys with DMD conducted at the Sydney Children's Hospital (SCH). All 62 children received neuropsychological testing from a single clinical psychologist and had a defined dystrophin gene (DMD) mutation; including DMD gene deletions, duplications and DNA point mutations. Full Scale Intelligence Quotients (FSIQ) in unrelated subjects with the same mutation were found to be highly correlated (r = 0.83, p = 0.0008), in contrast to results in previous publications. In 58 cases (94%) it was possible to definitively assign a mutation as affecting one or more dystrophin isoforms. A strong association between the risk of cognitive disability and the involvement of groups of DMD isoforms was found. In particular, improvements in the correlation of FSIQ with mutation location were identified when a new classification system for mutations affecting the Dp140 isoform was implemented.\nSIGNIFICANCE: These data represent one of the largest studies of FSIQ and mutational data in DMD patients and is among the first to report on a DMD cohort which has had both comprehensive mutational analysis and FSIQ testing through a single referral centre. The correlation between FSIQ results with the location of the dystrophin gene mutation suggests that the risk of cognitive deficit is a result of the cumulative loss of central nervous system (CNS) expressed dystrophin isoforms, and that correct classification of isoform involvement results in improved estimates of risk."

There are no longitudinal studies on the course of this pathology in Chile.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine survival between the years 1993-2013, divided into two periods (1993-2002 and 2003-2013), and the effect of social determinants in patients with DMD admitted in Teleton Institutes of Chile (TI).\nPATIENTS AND METHOD: Prospective follow-up study in a clinical series of 462 patients with DMD. The information was obtained by searching for patients with DMD in OLAP cube (Online Analytical Processing). From the clinical records of the TI of Santiago, the variables corresponding to the diagnostic method, stage of DMD described in terms of muscle de terioration and function according to Swinyard classification were recorded; existence and type of tests that conclude the diagnosis and, in the cases reported, the existence of family history. Kaplan Meier survival analysis was applied, where global survival was defined between birth and age of death. The determinant factors analyzed were estimated through the Cox-Snell's proportional risk model.\nRESULTS: Survival at 20 years of age from TI entry was 51.7% (CI95%: 45.1-57.8), 48.5% in the period 1993-2002 and 72.8% between 2003-2013. The percentage of survival at the same age according to socioeconomic status (SES) was 82% in high SES, 67% in middle SES, and 42% in low SES, with a statistically significant difference between high and middle SES in relation to extreme poverty. Ac cording to country areas, the survival was close to 75 % at 17 years of age.\nCONCLUSIONS: The survival information from patients with DMD from childhood to adult life is valuable for predicting the clinical course of the disease with the current medical care. There is evidence of improvement in the probability of survival at the age of 20 and marked inequity according to the socioeconomic variable."

Lower body muscle weakness progresses to non-ambulation typically by early teenage years, followed by upper body muscle deterioration and ultimately death by the late twenties. The objective of this study was to enhance the quantitative understanding of DMD disease progression through nonlinear mixed effects modeling of the population mean and variability of the 6-min walk test (6MWT) clinical endpoint. An indirect response model with a latent process was fit to digitized literature data using full Bayesian estimation. The modeling data set consisted of 22 healthy controls and 218 DMD patients from one interventional and four observational trials. The model reasonably described the central tendency and population variability of the 6MWT in healthy subjects and DMD patients. An exploratory categorical covariate analysis indicated that there was no apparent effect of corticosteroid administration on DMD disease progression. The population predicted 6MWT began to rise at 1.32 years of age, plateauing at 654 meters (m) at 17.2 years of age for the healthy population. The DMD trajectory reached a maximum of 411 m at 8.90 years before declining and falling below 1 m at age 18.0.

We developed a scoring system using clinical parameters and examined its efficacy. It is indispensable to utilize echocardiogram for evaluating myocardial damage of DMD patients, but there is no established guideline for determining the clinical conditions which require echocardiographic examination.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 86 patients with DMD who were treated in Kobe University Hospital from 2007 to 2009. The multiple logistic regression analysis on routine clinical data was performed to identify parameters that can find abnormal LV contraction, and to develop a weighted scoring system. Echocardiogram was performed as the gold standard for detecting LV dysfunction.\nRESULTS: Four parameters were associated with abnormal LV contraction: (i) brain natriuretic peptide (BNP); (ii) creatine kinase; (iii) scoliosis; and (iv) body surface area. When BNP was used as the only predictor to evaluate LV systolic dysfunction, sensitivity and specificity were 36.4% and 92.1%, respectively. In contrast, abnormal LV contraction was detected in high accuracy (sensitivity: 95.5%; specificity: 68.3%) when we used a two-step scoring system in which BNP was combined with the other three factors, raising the sensitivity compared to using BNP levels as the single parameter (P= 0.008).\nCONCLUSION: Our scoring system detects the early heart dysfunction of DMD patients, especially when BNP level is not elevated. This system is useful to determine the timing for echocardiographic examination and consulting cardiologists."

Fat fractions (FFs) in vastus lateralis and soleus muscles were determined with 1H MRS. MRI quantitative T<sub>2</sub> (qT<sub>2</sub>) values were measured for 3 muscles of the upper leg and 5 muscles of the lower leg. Longitudinal changes in biomarkers were modeled with a cumulative distribution function using a nonlinear mixed-effects approach.\nRESULTS: MRS FF and MRI qT<sub>2</sub> increased with DMD disease duration, with the progression time constants differing markedly between individuals and across muscles. The average age at half-maximal muscle involvement (\u03bc) occurred 4.8 years earlier in vastus lateralis than soleus, and these measures were strongly associated with loss-of-ambulation age. Corticosteroid treatment was found to delay \u03bc by 2.5 years on average across muscles, although there were marked differences between muscles with more slowly progressing muscles showing larger delay.\nCONCLUSIONS: MRS FF and MRI qT<sub>2</sub> provide sensitive noninvasive measures of DMD progression. Modeling changes in these biomarkers across multiple muscles can be used to detect and monitor the therapeutic effects of corticosteroids on disease progression and to provide prognostic information on functional outcomes. This modeling approach provides a method to transform these MRI biomarkers into well-understood metrics, allowing concise summaries of DMD disease progression at individual and population levels.\nCLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT01484678."

The objective was to inform the design of DMD clinical trials by developing a disease progression model-based clinical trial simulation (CTS) platform based on measures commonly used in DMD trials. Data were integrated from past studies through the Duchenne Regulatory Science Consortium founded by the Critical Path Institute (15\u00a0clinical trials and studies, 1505\u00a0subjects, 27,252 observations). Using a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach, longitudinal dynamics of five measures were modeled (NorthStar Ambulatory Assessment, forced vital capacity, and the velocities of the following three timed functional tests: time to stand from supine, time to climb 4\u00a0stairs, and 10\u00a0meter walk-run time). The models were validated on external data sets and captured longitudinal changes in the five measures well, including both early disease when function improves as a result of growth and development and the decline in function in later stages. The models can be used in the CTS platform to perform trial simulations to optimize the selection of inclusion/exclusion criteria, selection of measures, and other trial parameters. The data sets and models have been reviewed by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency; have been accepted into the Fit-for-Purpose and Qualification for Novel Methodologies pathways, respectively; and will be submitted for potential endorsement by both agencies."

This neuromuscular disorder affects male children, causing weakness and disability, whereas female relatives are at risk of being carriers of the disease. A biomarker with both high sensitivity and specificity for accurate prediction is preferred. Until now creatine kinase (CK) levels have been used for DMD diagnosis but these fail to assess disease progression. Herein we examined the potential applicability of serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and matrix metalloproteinase 2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1, myostatin (GDF-8) and follistatin (FSTN) as non-invasive biomarkers to distinguish between DMD steroid na\u00efve patients and healthy controls of similar age and also for carrier detection. Our data suggest that serum levels of MMP-9, GDF-8 and FSTN are useful to discriminate DMD from controls (p < 0.05), to correlate with some neuromuscular assessments for DMD, and also to differentiate between Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) patients. In DMD individuals under steroid treatment, GDF-8 levels increased as FSTN levels decreased, resembling the proportions of these proteins in healthy controls and also the baseline ratio of patients without steroids. GDF-8 and FSTN serum levels were also useful for carrier detection (p < 0.05). Longitudinal studies with larger cohorts are necessary to confirm that these molecules correlate with disease progression. The biomarkers presented herein could potentially outperform CK levels for carrier detection and also harbor potential for monitoring disease progression."

A highly promising approach to therapy, applicable to all DMD patients irrespective to their genetic defect, is to modulate utrophin, a functional paralogue of dystrophin, able to compensate for the primary defects of DMD restoring sarcolemmal stability. One of the major difficulties in assessing the effectiveness of therapeutic strategies is to define appropriate outcome measures. In the present study, we utilised an aptamer based proteomics approach to profile 1,310 proteins in plasma of wild-type, mdx and Fiona (mdx overexpressing utrophin) mice. Comparison of the C57 and mdx sera revealed 83 proteins with statistically significant >2 fold changes in dystrophic serum abundance. A large majority of previously described biomarkers (ANP32B, THBS4, CAMK2A/B/D, CYCS, CAPNI) were normalised towards wild-type levels in Fiona animals. This work also identified potential mdx markers specific to increased utrophin (DUS3, TPI1) and highlights novel mdx biomarkers (GITR, MYBPC1, HSP60, SIRT2, SMAD3, CNTN1). We define a panel of putative protein mdx biomarkers to evaluate utrophin based strategies which may help to accelerate their translation to the clinic."

The aim of the present study was to identify urinary biomarkers as a diagnostic tool for muscular dystrophies. Here, the urinary proteomes of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients and healthy donors were compared with a bottom-up proteomic approach. Label-free analysis of more than 1100 identified proteins revealed that 32 of them were differentially expressed between healthy controls and DMD patients. Among these 32 proteins, titin showed the highest fold change between healthy subjects and DMD patients. Interestingly, most of the sequenced peptides belong to the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of titin, and the presence of the corresponding fragments in the urine of DMD patients was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Analysis of a large cohort of DMD patients and age-matched controls (a total of 104 individuals aged from 3 to 20 years) confirmed presence of the N-ter fragment in all but two patients. In two DMD patients aged 16 and 20 years this fragment was undetectable and two healthy controls of 16 and 19 years with serum CK >800 IU/L demonstrated a low level of the fragment. N- and C-terminal titin fragments were also detected in urine from patients with other muscular dystrophies such as Becker muscular dystrophy and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (type 1D, 2D and 2J) but not in neurogenic spinal muscular atrophy. They were also present in urine of dystrophin-deficient animal models (GRMD dogs and mdx mice). Titin is the first urinary biomarker that offers the possibility to develop a simple, non-invasive and easy-to-use test for pre-screening of muscular dystrophies, and may also prove to be useful for the non-invasive follow up of DMD patients under treatment."

To further explore the possibility of OPN as a new biomarker for disease activity in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, we monitored serum OPN levels in dystrophic and wild-type dogs at different ages and compared the levels to other serum markers, such as serum creatine kinase, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1. Serum OPN levels in the dystrophic dogs were significantly elevated compared with those in wild-type dogs before and 1 hour after a cesarean section birth and at the age of 3 months. The serum OPN level was significantly correlated with the phenotypic severity of dystrophic dogs at the period corresponding to the onset of muscle weakness, whereas other serum markers including creatine kinase were not. Immunohistologically, OPN was up-regulated in infiltrating macrophages and developmental myosin heavy chain-positive regenerating muscle fibers in the dystrophic dogs, whereas serum OPN was highly elevated. OPN expression was also observed during the synergic muscle regeneration process induced by cardiotoxin injection. In conclusion, OPN is a promising biomarker for muscle regeneration in dystrophic dogs and can be applicable to boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy."

We evaluated article quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute scale. Information regarding the samples included, muscles evaluated, MRI protocols and motor function tests used was collected from each article. Correlations between MRI measurements and motor function were reported exhaustively.\nRESULTS: Seventeen of 1,629 studies identified were included. Most patients included were ambulant with a mean age of 8.9 years. Most studies evaluated lower limb muscles. Moderate to excellent correlations were found between MRI measurements and motor function. The strongest correlations were found for quantitative MRI measurements such as fat fraction or mean T2. Correlations were stronger for lower leg muscles such as soleus. One longitudinal study reported that changes in soleus mean T2 were highly correlated with changes in motor function.\nCONCLUSION: The findings of this systematic review showed that MRI measurements can be used as biomarkers of disease severity in ambulant patients with DMD. Guidelines are proposed to help clinicians choose the most appropriate MRI measurements and muscles to evaluate. Studies exploring upper limb muscles, other stages of the disease, and sensitivity of measurements to change are needed."

While the precise mechanisms of progressive dystropathology remain unclear, oxidative stress caused by excessive generation of oxidants is strongly implicated. Blood biomarkers that could track oxidant levels in tissues would be valuable to measure the effectiveness of clinical treatments for DMD; our research has focused on developing such biomarkers. One target of oxidants that has the potential to be harnessed as a clinical biomarker is the thiol side chain of cysteine 34 (Cys34) of the blood protein albumin. This study using the mdx mouse model of DMD shows that in plasma, albumin Cys34 undergoes thiol oxidation and these changes correlate with levels of protein thiol oxidation and damage of the dystrophic muscles. A comparison with the commonly used biomarker protein carbonylation, confirmed that albumin thiol oxidation is the more sensitive plasma biomarker of oxidative stress occurring in muscle tissue. We show that plasma albumin oxidation reflects muscle dystropathology, as increased after exercise and decreased after taurine treatment of mdx mice. These data support the use of albumin thiol oxidation as a blood biomarker of dystropathology to assist with advancing clinical development of therapies for DMD."

However, its pathological process remains unknown and there is a lack of specific molecular biomarkers. The aim of our study is to explore key regulatory connections underlying the progression of DMD.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The gene expression profile dataset GSE38417 of DMD was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between DMD patients and healthy controls were screened using geo2R, followed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) pathway enrichment analyses. Then a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and sub-network of modules were constructed. To investigate the regulatory network underlying DMD, a global triple network including miRNAs, mRNAs and transcription factors (TFs) was constructed.\nRESULTS: A total of 1811 DEGs were found between the DMD and control groups, among which HERC5, SKP2 and FBXW5 were defined as hub genes with a degree of connectivity >35 in the PPI network. Furthermore, the five TFs ZNF362, ATAT1, SPI1, TCF12 and ABCF2, as well as the eight miRNAs miR-124a, miR-200b/200c/429, miR-19a/b, miR-23a/b, miR-182, miR-144, miR-498 and miR-18a/b were identified as playing crucial roles in the molecular pathogenesis of DMD.\nCONCLUSIONS: This paper provides a comprehensive perspective on the miRNA-TF-mRNA co-regulatory network underlying DMD, although the bioinformatic findings need further validation in future studies."

We collected clinical data and 303 blood samples from 157 DMD patients in three clinical centres; 78 patients contributed multiple blood samples over time, with a median follow-up time of 2 years. We employed linear mixed models to identify biomarkers that are associated with disease progression, wheelchair dependency, and treatment with corticosteroids and performed survival analysis to find biomarkers whose levels are associated with time to loss of ambulation.\nRESULTS: Our analysis led to the identification of 21 proteins whose levels significantly decrease with age and nine proteins whose levels significantly increase. Seven of these proteins are also differentially expressed in non-ambulant patients, and three proteins are differentially expressed in patients treated with glucocorticosteroids. Treatment with corticosteroids was found to partly counteract the effect of disease progression on two biomarkers, namely, malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2, P = 0.0003) and ankyrin repeat domain 2 (P = 0.0005); however, patients treated with corticosteroids experienced a further reduction on collagen 1 serum levels (P = 0.0003), especially following administration of deflazacort. A time to event analysis allowed to further support the use of MDH2 as a prognostic biomarker as it was associated with an increased risk of wheelchair dependence (P = 0.0003). The obtained data support the prospective evaluation of the identified biomarkers in natural history and clinical trials as exploratory biomarkers.\nCONCLUSIONS: We identified a number of serum biomarkers associated with disease progression, loss of ambulation, and treatment with corticosteroids. The identified biomarkers are promising candidate prognostic and surrogate biomarkers, which may support drug developers if confirmed in prospective studies. The serum levels of MDH2 are of particular interest, as they correlate with disease stage and response to treatment with corticosteroids, and are also associated with the risk of wheelchair dependency and pulmonary function."

This is a prospective, cross-sectional, observational study of 30 DMD subjects measuring native T1 levels and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac MR imaging (CMR) correlated with temporally associated serum troponin I levels. Non-parametric analyses including Spearman correlations and Kruskal-Wallis test were performed between groups. p values resulting from the pair-wise comparisons were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Sidak method where appropriate. There were 15 DMD subjects with no LGE (age 12\u2009\u00b1\u20093 yo; EF% 60\u2009\u00b1\u20095) and troponin I level of 0.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08\u00a0ng/ml, of which three had an abnormal troponin level (over 0.04\u00a0ng/ml); 7 DMD subjects with mild LGE (age 17\u2009\u00b1\u20095 yo, EF% 52\u2009\u00b1\u20098) and troponin I level of 0.28\u2009\u00b1\u20090.36\u00a0ng/ml, of which five had an abnormal troponin level; and 8 DMD subjects with moderate-to-severe LGE (age 16\u2009\u00b1\u20096 yo; EF% 54\u2009\u00b1\u20098) and troponin I level of 0.11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14\u00a0ng/ml, of which four had an abnormal troponin level. Troponin I levels in DMD subjects with mild LGE was significantly increased compared to subjects with no LGE (p\u2009=\u20090.02). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between troponin I levels and MOLLI septal native T1 values (r2\u2009=\u20090.173, p\u2009=\u20090.02). Overall, MOLLI lateral native T1 levels were increased with moderate-severe LGE compared to mild and none (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01). Serum biomarker troponin I levels were increased in DMD subjects with mild LGE and correlated with MOLLI septal native T1 values. Troponin I levels may be a useful minimally invasive outcome marker to monitor myocardial disease progression in DMD cardiomyopathy."

In this study, we hypothesized that muscle-specific microRNAs (miR-1, -133, and -206) in serum may be useful for monitoring the DMD pathological progression, and explored the possibility of these miRNAs as potential non-invasive biomarkers for the disease. By using real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in a randomized and controlled trial, we detected that miR-1, -133, and -206 were significantly over-expressed in the serum of 39 children with DMD (up to 3.20 \u00b1 1.20, 2(-\u0394\u0394Ct) ): almost 2- to 4-fold enriched in comparison to samples from the healthy controls (less than 1.15 \u00b1 0.34, 2(-\u0394\u0394Ct) ). To determine whether these miRNAs were related to the clinical features of children with DMD, we analyzed the associations compared to creatine kinase. There were very good inverse correlations between the levels of these miRNAs, especially miR-206, and functional performances: high levels corresponded to low muscle strength, muscle function, and quality of life. Moreover, by receiver operating characteristic curves analyses, we revealed that these miRNAs, especially miR-206, were able to discriminate DMD from controls. Thus, miR-206 and other muscle-specific miRNAs in serum are useful for monitoring the DMD pathological progression, and hence as potential non-invasive biomarkers for the disease. There has been a long-standing need for reliable, non-invasive biomarkers for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). We found that the levels of muscle-specific microRNAs, especially miR-206, in the serum of DMD were 2- to 4-fold higher than in the controls. High levels corresponded to low muscle strength, muscle function, and quality of life (QoL). These miRNAs were able to discriminate DMD from controls by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analyses. Thus, miR-206 and other muscle-specific miRNAs are useful as non-invasive biomarkers for DMD."

We identified 41 and 33 dysfunctional pathways that were enriched with differentially expressed genes in presymptomatic patients and in symptomatic patients, respectively. Over 70% of pathways were shared between both phases and many of them involved the inflammatory process, suggesting that inflammatory cascades were induced soon after the birth of the patients. Further investigation showed that presymptomatic patients performed better with respect to muscle regeneration and cardiac muscle calcium homeostasis maintenance. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase, dihydropyridine receptors, sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, and phospholamban may serve as potential targets for further molecular diagnostic tests. Our results may provide a better understanding for the treatment of DMD."

We used linear regressions to model the association of three sociodemographic characteristics with age at initial medical evaluation, first creatine kinase measurement, and earliest DNA analysis while controlling for changes in the diagnostic process over time. The analytical dataset included 375 males with information on family history of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy, neighborhood poverty levels, and race/ethnicity.\nRESULTS: Black and Hispanic race/ethnicity predicted older ages at initial evaluation, creatine kinase measurement, and DNA testing (P < 0.05). A positive family history of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy predicted younger ages at initial evaluation, creatine kinase measurement and DNA testing (P < 0.001). Higher neighborhood poverty was associated with earlier ages of evaluation (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Racial and ethnic disparities in the diagnostic process for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy are evident even after adjustment for family history of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy and changes in the diagnostic process over time. Black and Hispanic children are initially evaluated at older ages than white children, and the gap widens at later steps in the diagnostic process."

The CF patient registry allows for reporting of standard outcomes across clinics and is associated with improved CF outcomes.

Suggested metrics for quality care include molecular diagnosis, ambulatory status and age at loss of ambulation, age requiring ventilator support, and survival.\nCONCLUSIONS: CF longevity has increased by almost 33% from 1986 to 2010, in part due to a CF patient registry that has been stratified by individual care centers since 1999, and publically available since 2006.

Using an online patient self-report survey model, Duchenne Connect provides relevant data that are difficult to gather in other ways. Validation of the overall dataset is supported by comparable mutational spectrum relative to other cohorts and demonstrated beneficial effect of corticosteroid use in prolonging ambulation. These types of analyses are provocative and allow multivariate analyses across the breadth of patient and physician medication and supplement practices. Because the data are self-reported and online, the barrier to participation is low and great potential exists for novel directions of further research in a highly participatory forum.\nSUMMARY: Patient registries for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD) are powerful tools for monitoring patient outcomes, comparing treatment options, and relating information between patients, researchers, and clinicians. Duchenne Connect is an online patient self-report registry for individuals with DBMD that facilitates aggregation of treatment modalities, outcomes, and genotype data and has played a vital role in furthering DBMD research, particularly in the USA, in a highly participatory and low-cost manner."

Secondly, we constructed differentially regulated networks to integrate the TF-to-target information and the differential co-expression genes.\nRESULTS: A total of 454 DEGs were detected and both KEGG pathway and ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that pathways enriched with aberrantly regulated genes are mostly involved in the immune response processes. DCEA results generated 610 pairs of DEGs regulated by at least one common TF, including 78 pairs of co-expressed DEGs. A network was constructed to illustrate their relationships and a subnetwork for DMD related molecules was constructed to show genes and TFs that may play important roles in the secondary changes of DMD. Among the DEGs which shared TFs with DMD, six genes were co-expressed with DMD, including ATP1A2, C1QB, MYOF, SAT1, TRIP10, and IFI6.\nCONCLUSION: Our results may provide a new understanding of DMD and contribute potential targets for future therapeutic tests.\nVIRTUAL SLIDES: The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/13000_2014_210."

The objective of this study was to describe in detail the injection site reactions in these children treated with drisapersen (PRO-051), a 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate RNA antisense oligonucleotide, that induces exon 51 skipping in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Antisense oligonucleotides, restoring the reading frame by skipping of exons, have become a potential treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and other monogenetic diseases. Erythema followed by hyperpigmentation, fibrosis, and calcification were seen at the injection sites in all children. Ulcerations, which were difficult to heal, occurred in 5 of 7 children. Progression still occurred after switching to intravenous administration of drisapersen or even after stopping therapy. Systemic reactions included a reversible proteinuria and \u03b11-microglobulinuria. Moreover, hypotrichosis was a common feature.Conclusion: Subcutaneous administration of drisapersen causes severe and progressive injection site effects. What is known: \u2022 Antisense oligonucleotides offer the possibility to convert Duchenne muscular dystrophy to the less severe Becker type. This can potentially be achieved by targeting and skipping specific exons of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene to restore the disrupted reading frame and to induce the production of a semi functional dystrophin protein. \u2022 Drisapersen is such an antisense oligonucleotides which can be administered subcutaneously. Its use has been tested extensively in the escalating dose pilot study (PRO051-02). What is new: \u2022 This report describes the injection site reactions caused by this type of agent in detail which has never been done before.

Data were presented from eight multicenter longitudinal datasets, representing nearly 1900 patients over a 20-year time period. This experience confirmed the feasibility of repeated evaluations performed at multiple sites and addressed several core issues in drug development for DMD, such as the 'new' natural history in the steroidera, reliability and sensitivity of specific outcome measures, as well as disease staging and patient selection. These data form a valuable asset for academic investigators, pharmaceutical sponsors and regulatory agencies involved in DMD therapeutics.

However, gene-editing alone is not enough to restore the healthy phenotype and additional treatments are required. In the present study, we have first conducted a meta-analysis of three microarray datasets, GSE38417, GSE3307, and GSE6011, to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between healthy donors and DMD patients. We have then integrated this analysis with the knowledge obtained from DisGeNET and DIAMOnD, a well-known algorithm for drug-gene association discoveries in the human interactome. The data obtained allowed us to identify novel possible target genes and were used to predict potential therapeutical options that could reverse the pathological condition."

In this article, we present DNet, a method for the identification of significant disease subnetworks by integrating both the network structure and gene expression information. Our work will lead to the identification of missing key disease genes, which are be highly expressed in a disease-specific gene expression dataset. The experimental evaluation of our method on both the Leukemia and the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy gene expression datasets show that DNet performs better than the existing state-of-the-art methods.

The objective was to inform the design of DMD clinical trials by developing a disease progression model-based clinical trial simulation (CTS) platform based on measures commonly used in DMD trials. Data were integrated from past studies through the Duchenne Regulatory Science Consortium founded by the Critical Path Institute (15\u00a0clinical trials and studies, 1505\u00a0subjects, 27,252 observations). Using a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach, longitudinal dynamics of five measures were modeled (NorthStar Ambulatory Assessment, forced vital capacity, and the velocities of the following three timed functional tests: time to stand from supine, time to climb 4\u00a0stairs, and 10\u00a0meter walk-run time). The models were validated on external data sets and captured longitudinal changes in the five measures well, including both early disease when function improves as a result of growth and development and the decline in function in later stages. The models can be used in the CTS platform to perform trial simulations to optimize the selection of inclusion/exclusion criteria, selection of measures, and other trial parameters. The data sets and models have been reviewed by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency; have been accepted into the Fit-for-Purpose and Qualification for Novel Methodologies pathways, respectively; and will be submitted for potential endorsement by both agencies."

We analyzed medical records of 453 Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy boys to document the time course and steps taken to reach a definitive diagnosis.\nRESULTS: Among 156 boys without known family history of DMD prior to birth, first signs or symptoms were noted at a mean age of 2.5 years. Concerns resulted in primary care provider evaluation of the child at a mean age of 3.6 years. Mean age at time of initial creatine kinase was 4.7 years. Mean age at definitive diagnosis of DMD was 4.9 years.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is a delay of about 2.5 years between onset of DMD symptoms and the time of definitive diagnosis, unchanged over the previous 2 decades. This delay results in lost opportunities for timely genetic counseling and initiation of corticosteroid treatment. We recommend checking creatine kinase early in the evaluation of boys with unexplained developmental delay."

However, its pathological process remains unknown and there is a lack of specific molecular biomarkers. The aim of our study is to explore key regulatory connections underlying the progression of DMD.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The gene expression profile dataset GSE38417 of DMD was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between DMD patients and healthy controls were screened using geo2R, followed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) pathway enrichment analyses. Then a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and sub-network of modules were constructed. To investigate the regulatory network underlying DMD, a global triple network including miRNAs, mRNAs and transcription factors (TFs) was constructed.\nRESULTS: A total of 1811 DEGs were found between the DMD and control groups, among which HERC5, SKP2 and FBXW5 were defined as hub genes with a degree of connectivity >35 in the PPI network. Furthermore, the five TFs ZNF362, ATAT1, SPI1, TCF12 and ABCF2, as well as the eight miRNAs miR-124a, miR-200b/200c/429, miR-19a/b, miR-23a/b, miR-182, miR-144, miR-498 and miR-18a/b were identified as playing crucial roles in the molecular pathogenesis of DMD.\nCONCLUSIONS: This paper provides a comprehensive perspective on the miRNA-TF-mRNA co-regulatory network underlying DMD, although the bioinformatic findings need further validation in future studies."

Clinical trial participation and individual-level clinical and sociodemographic characteristics were obtained from medical records for the 2000-2015 calendar years. County-level characteristics were determined from linkage of the most recent county of residence identified from medical records and publicly available federal datasets. Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon two-sample tests were used with statistical significance set at one-sided p-value (&lt;0.05) based on the hypothesis that nonparticipants had fewer resources.\nRESULTS: Clinical trial participation was identified among 17.9% (MD STARnet site: 3.7-27.3%) of 358 individuals with DMD. Corticosteroids, tadalafil, and ataluren (PTC124) were the most common trial medications recorded. Fewer non-Hispanic blacks or Hispanics than non-Hispanic whites participated in clinical trials. Trial participants tended to reside in counties with lower percentages of non-Hispanic blacks. Conclusion: Understanding characteristics associated with clinical trial participation is critical for identifying participation barriers and generalizability of trial results. MD STARnet is uniquely able to track clinical trial participation through surveillance and describe patterns of participation."

To investigate gene expression in dystrophic muscle we have applied mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) microarray technology to the mdx mouse model of DMD. This study was designed to generate a complete description of gene expression changes associated with dystrophic pathology and the response to an experimental therapy which restores dystrophin protein function. These datasets have enabled (1) the determination of gene expression changes associated with dystrophic pathology, (2) identification of differentially expressed genes that are restored towards wild-type levels after therapeutic dystrophin rescue, (3) investigation of the correlation between mRNA and protein expression (determined by parallel mass spectrometry proteomics analysis), and (4) prediction of pathology associated miRNA-target interactions.

Characterizing the phenotypes and subphenotypes aids researchers in the design of clinical studies and clinicians in providing anticipatory guidance to affected individuals and their families. Using data from the Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance, Tracking, and Research Network (MD STARnet), we used K-means cluster analysis to group phenotypically similar males with pediatric-onset dystrophinopathy. We identified four dystrophinopathy clusters: Classical BMD, Classical DMD, late ambulatory DMD, and severe DMD. The clusters that we identified align with both 'classical' and 'non-classical' dystrophinopathy described in the literature. Individuals with dystrophinopathies have heterogenous clinical presentations that cluster into phenotypically similar groups. Use of clinically-derived phenotyping may provide a clearer understanding of disease trajectories, reduce variability in study results, and prevent exclusion of certain cohorts from analysis. Findings from studying subphenotypes may ultimately improve our ability to predict disease progression."

A better understanding of physical activity pattern and energy expenditure (EE) would lead to a more targeted approach to intervention.\nOBJECTIVE: This study focuses on studying the use of machine-learning algorithms for EE estimation in children with disabilities. A pilot study was conducted on children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) to identify important factors for determining EE and develop a novel algorithm to accurately estimate EE from wearable sensor-collected data.\nMETHODS: There were 7 boys with DMD, 6 healthy control boys, and 22 control adults recruited. Data were collected using smartphone accelerometer and chest-worn heart rate sensors. The gold standard EE values were obtained from the COSMED K4b2 portable cardiopulmonary metabolic unit worn by boys (aged 6-10 years) with DMD and controls. Data from this sensor setup were collected simultaneously during a series of concurrent activities. Linear regression and nonlinear machine-learning-based approaches were used to analyze the relationship between accelerometer and heart rate readings and COSMED values.\nRESULTS: Existing calorimetry equations using linear regression and nonlinear machine-learning-based models, developed for healthy adults and young children, give low correlation to actual EE values in children with disabilities (14%-40%). The proposed model for boys with DMD uses ensemble machine learning techniques and gives a 91% correlation with actual measured EE values (root mean square error of 0.017).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that the methods developed to determine EE using accelerometer and heart rate sensor values in normal adults are not appropriate for children with disabilities and should not be used. A much more accurate model is obtained using machine-learning-based nonlinear regression specifically developed for this target population."

The early identification of functional and motor impairments can support clinical decision making.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the motor and functional impairments of 10 female patients with dystrophinopathy diagnosed with clinical, pathological, genetic and immunohistochemical studies.\nMETHODS: A descriptive study of a sample of symptomatic female carriers of DMD mutations. The studied variables were muscular strength and functional performance.\nRESULTS: The prevalence was 10/118 (8.4%) symptomatic female carriers. Deletions were found in seven patients. The age of onset of symptoms in female carriers of DMD was quite variable. Pseudohypertrophy of calf muscles, muscular weakness, compensatory movements and longer timed performance on functional tasks were observed in most of the cases. Differently from males with DMD, seven female patients showed asymmetrical muscular weakness. The asymmetric presentation of muscle weakness was frequent and affected posture and functionality in some cases. The functional performance presents greater number of compensatory movements. Time of execution of activities was not a good biomarker of functionality for this population, because it does not change in the same proportion as the number of movement compensations.\nCONCLUSION: Clinical manifestation of asymmetrical muscle weakness and compensatory movements, or both can be found in female carriers of DMD mutations, which can adversely affect posture and functional performance of these patients."

We present clinical and radiological outcome measures used in ambulatory patients participating in our trial \"Treatment with L-citrulline and metformin in Duchenne muscular dystrophy\". The motor function measure is a validated test in patients with neuromuscular disorders that consists of 32 items and assesses all three dimensions of motor performance including standing and transfer (D1 subscore), axial and proximal motor function (D2 subscore), and distal motor function (D3 subscore). The test shows high intra- and inter-rater variability but only when strictly following guidelines of the materials, examination steps, and calculation of scores. The 6-minute walk test, timed 10-meter walk/run test, and supine-up time are commonly used timed functional tests that also sufficiently monitor changes in muscle function; however, they strongly depend on patient collaboration. Quantitative MRI is an objective and sensitive biomarker to detect subclinical changes, though the examination costs may be a reason for its limited use. In this study, a high correlation between all clinical assessments and quantitative MRI scans was found. The combinational use of these methods provides a better understanding about disease progression; however, longitudinal studies are needed to validate their reliability."

This cohort was assessed longitudinally over a 12 months period of time with 3 monthly assessments for QMT and with assessment of functional abilities, using the NSAA and the 6MWT at baseline and at 12 months only. QMT was also used in a control group of 13 healthy age-matched boys examined at baseline and at 12 months.\nRESULTS: There was an increase in QMT over 12 months in boys below the age of 7.5 years while in boys above the age of 7.5 years, QMT showed a significant decrease. All the average one-year changes were significantly different than those experienced by healthy controls.

To quantify the extent of disease progression, muscle force and functional ability can be measured. Which of these parameters changes most depends on the disease stage. In a previous study, we reported normal values for muscle force obtained by hand-held dynamometry in healthy children aged 4-16 years. In the present study, we report normal values for timed functional tests in healthy children aged 4-11 years. These normal values were compared with values obtained in 16 ambulant patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) aged 5-8 years to study the extent of functional impairment. In ambulant patients with DMD, we found that muscle function assessed by timed functional tests (running 9 m and rising up from the floor) and muscle force assessed by hand-held dynamometry were severely impaired. However, a small reduction of muscle force was accompanied by a large reduction in functional ability. Therefore, in our group of ambulant patients with DMD, timed functional testing was the most sensitive parameter to determine the extent of disease progression. Timed functional testing may therefore be considered as an additional outcome measure in drug trials to evaluate the effects of therapy in ambulant patients with DMD and possibly in other neuromuscular disorders."

Cases were recruited from the database of the pediatric neurology department and the healthy, from child care consultations, with normal gait development (up to 15 months) and without other comorbidities (neuromuscular, pulmonary, heart diseases) from the same university hospital.\nRESULTS: 128 Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients and 344 healthy children were analyzed, equally distributed in age groups. In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, there is a progressive increase in the means of the times to perform the motor tests according to the age group, which accelerates very abruptly after 7 years of age. Healthy children acquire maximum motor capacity at 6 years and stabilize their times. The time to rise showed a p-value <0.05 and a strong association (effect size [ES] >0.8) in all age groups (except at 12 years), with time to walk 10 meters from 9 years, and with time to run 10\u2009meters , from 5 years.

Currently, functional measures continue to serve as the primary outcome for the majority of DMD clinical trials. Quantitative measures of muscle health, including magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy, electrical impedance myography, and ultrasound, sensitively identify diseased muscle, disease progression, and response to a therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, such non-invasive techniques have the potential to identify disease pathology prior to onset of clinical symptoms. Despite robust supportive evidence, non-invasive quantitative techniques are still not frequently utilized in clinical trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

The most recent advances in therapeutic strategies for the treatment of DMD involve exon skipping or administration of minidystrophin, but these strategies are not yet universally available, nor have they proven to be a definitive cure for all DMD patients. Early diagnosis and tracking of symptom progression of DMD usually relies on creatine kinase tests, evaluation of patient performance in various ambulatory assessments, and detection of dystrophin from muscle biopsies, which are invasive and painful for the patient. While the current research focuses primarily on restoring functional dystrophin, accurate and minimally invasive methods to detect and track both symptom progression and the success of early DMD treatments are not yet available. In recent years, several groups have identified miRNA signature changes in DMD tissue samples, and a number of promising studies consistently detected changes in circulating miRNAs in blood samples of DMD patients. These results could potentially lead to non-invasive detection methods, new molecular approaches to treating DMD symptoms, and new methods to monitor of the efficacy of the therapy.

Whole-exome sequencing is considered as the diagnostic strategy of choice in these cases. In this study we aimed to determine the mutational spectrum of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)-negative muscular dystrophy patients in Pakistan using whole-exome sequencing. Subsequently the mutations identified via WES were used to screen additional dystrophinopathy patients by Sanger sequencing. Materials and Methods: DNA extracted from the peripheral blood of three MLPA-negative muscular dystrophy patients was sent for whole-exome sequencing. The identified variants in these 3 patients were then checked in 18 dystrophinopathy patients using Sanger sequencing. Results: Four missense variants and one nonsense variant in the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene were detected. WES diagnosed a DMD patient carrying a nonsense variant c.4375C&gt;T (rs398123953) who can benefit from Ataluren therapy. The other two patients carried missense variant (c.572G&gt;T) in the YARS2 gene (rs11539445) labeling them as patients of MLASA (myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia). The identified missense and nonsense variants in the DMD gene were detected in 18 clinically diagnosed dystrophinopathy patients using Sanger sequencing. Three missense variants were detected in our cohort of 18 dystrophinopathy patients. One missense variant c.3406A&gt;T (rs3827462) and a nonsense variant c.4375C&gt;T (rs398123953) were not detected in our cohort of 18 dystrophinopathy patients. Conclusions: Whole-exome sequencing identified a nonsense variant in Pakistani muscular dystrophy patients, which is amenable to treatment by Ataluren and a missense variant in YARS2 gene responsible for causing MLASA."

Whole-exome sequencing was utilized to detect disease-causing variants in 40 MLPA-negative DMD patients. Disease-causing variants were detected in the DMD gene in 36/40 of the patients (90%), and 4/40 of them (10%) remained undiagnosed. WES analysis revealed that nonsense variant was the most common type in our study (23/36 of the cases). Besides, 12/36 of the cases had frameshift variant, and one of the patients had a likely pathogenic splice variant in the DMD gene. Carrier testing revealed that 21/40 of the mothers had the identified variant. Therefore, most variants were inherited (58.3%), while 19/40 were de novo (41. 7%). The present study has demonstrated the importance of performing WES to detect disease-causing point mutations in MLPA-negative DMD patients and to identify carrier females. Due to regulatory challenges, the clinical development of therapeutic approaches is time-consuming and may not be available to all patients shortly. Therefore, it appears that the techniques used to accurately detect disease-causing variants in carrier mothers are a more efficient solution to prevent the increased prevalence of DMD."

METHODS; From January 2000 - May 2007, genetic diagnostic testing for DMD/BMD was undertaken in 128 male patients using mPCR. From May 2007 onwards, MLPA replaced this technique and 261 males were investigated. MLPA is a kit-based technology available from MRC-Holland.Results. Of the 128 and 261 probands tested using mPCR and MLPA, respectively, 31% and 34% were found to carry a deletion mutation. Further, MLPA could detect duplication mutations (11.5%), complex rearrangements (1.5%) and small mutations (1.5%). In black patients, deletion mutations were found to cluster in the 3' region of the gene. No population-specific pathogenic mutations were found.\nCONCLUSIONS: The mutation detection rate for mPCR and MLPA is similar for deletion mutations, but MLPA proved to be a better diagnostic approach as it could detect other types of mutations as well, including duplications, complex rearrangements and small mutations. MLPA could also diagnose mutation status in at-risk female relatives, which is not possible with mPCR."

The mutation spectrum of DMD is unique in that 65% of causative mutations are intragenic deletions, with intragenic duplications and point mutations (along with other sequence variants) accounting for 6% to 10% and 30% to 35%, respectively. The strategy for molecular diagnostic testing for DMD involves initial screening for deletions/duplications using microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) followed by full-sequence analysis of DMD for sequence variants. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based targeted gene analysis has become clinically available for detection of point mutations and other sequence variants (small insertions, deletions, and indels). This unit initially discusses the strategic algorithm for establishing a molecular diagnosis of DMD and later provides detailed protocols of current molecular diagnostic methods for DMD, including array-CGH, PCR-based Sanger sequencing, and NGS-based sequencing assay."

NGS-based sequencing of DMD gene was done in 28 MLPA-negative cases (25 male probands with the DMD phenotype and 3 obligate carrier mothers of deceased affected male patients) and disease-causing variants were identified in 19 (67.9%) of these cases. Further molecular testing in four of the remaining nine cases revealed gene variants associated with limb girdle muscular dystrophies.

The most basic method still in regular use involves multiplex PCR of the exons, known to be most commonly deleted. The multiplex is relatively simple. Quantitative analysis of all exons of the gene and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification have brought about an improvement in mutation detection rate, as they will detect all exon scale deletions as well as duplications, widely used to detect exonic and intronic mutations. As a sensitive and discriminative tool, MLPA can be used for prenatal testing.

It is characterized by the slow degeneration of muscle fibres, so that the patient has become an invalid by the age of 10 years, followed by death from respiratory or cardiac failure. It has a sex linked recessive mode of inheritance.\nDEVELOPMENT: The gene causing this disorder is the DMD gene and is found on the short arm of the X chromosome. The commonest mutations of this gene are deletions. Many molecular techniques for study of the disorder have been developed over the years. These include the Southern Blot, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), use of the Short Tandem Repeat (STR), polymorphic length restriction fragments (RFLP), Western Blot for the study of the protein and others.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this paper we review the diagnostic tests most widely used in this disease. These have permitted improved study of the various families affected and thus improved the quality of life of the families at risk."

The mean age of onset was 3.2 years and the mean age at presentation was 7.2 years. 110/120 cases were confirmed by genetic testing and six were by absence of staining for dystrophin on muscle biopsy. DMD gene deletion was present in 78.5%, duplication in 5.3% and point mutation in 11.2% cases. 70.3% of patients had deletion located at a distal hot spot region. Single exon deletion was found in 16.5%. Distal hotspot exons 47, 48 and 50 were the commonly deleted exons.\nCONCLUSIONS: In our study, 94.8% cases showed genetic change in the DMD gene. Muscle biopsy was the choice of investigation in earlier days. Detection of DMD by DNA based method eliminates the need to do an invasive procedure for diagnosis. Hence the genetic testing should be the investigation of choice in suspected cases of DMD. The pattern of deletion, obtained in the population of Rajasthan was similar when compared with other ethnic groups of the Indian population. It would be helpful for researchers to develop drugs specific to exons or for ongoing mutation-specific therapies."

We investigated 71 families with more than one individual affected by ALS for clinical features and SOD-1 mutations. Mutations were identified in 14 families, indicating the presence of SOD-1 mutations in around 20% of this population. There were 10 different heterozygote missense point mutations in eight different codons, and a novel two-base frameshift insertion (132insTT), which leads to substitution of aspartic acid for glutamic acid at codon 132, and a premature stop codon at 133, with predicted truncation of the protein. SOD enzyme activity was reduced to around 50% of normal in individuals with SOD-1 mutations, and may be a useful predictor for the presence of these mutations. A predilection for disease onset in the lower limbs appears to be a distinguishing feature of familial ALS with SOD-1 mutations, and accords with findings in transgenic mouse models. In general, the finding of an SOD-1 mutation does not accurately predict a prognosis or disease severity."

Here we report a novel mutation in exon 4 of SOD1 gene in a 55-year-old ALS patient belonging to a large Italian family with ALS first clinically described in 1968. In the family the clinical presentation was characterized by relatively early age of onset, spinal onset with proximal distribution weakness, bulbar involvement and a rapid disease course. Molecular analysis showed a heterozygous mutation at codon 106 resulting in a substitution of phenylalanine for leucine in the SOD1 protein (L106F). In analogy with the previously reported L106V mutation, we propose that the L106F causes a relevant destabilization of the protein chain around the mutation site, able to affect the SOD1 monomer and dimer structures suggesting a pathogenic role for this novel mutation."

Recently, we have reproduced the formation of SOD1 oligomers abnormally cross-linked via disulfide bonds in a test tube. Using our in vitro model of SOD1 oligomerization, therefore, we screened 640 FDA-approved drugs for inhibiting the oligomerization of SOD1 proteins, and three effective classes of chemical compounds were identified.

Both disorders are characterized by the accumulation of pathological protein aggregates that contain a number of proteins, most notably TAR DNA binding protein 43\u2009kDa (TDP-43). Surprisingly, recent clinical studies suggest that dyslipidemia, high body mass index, and type 2 diabetes mellitus are associated with better clinical outcomes in ALS. Moreover, ALS and FTLD patients have a significantly lower incidence of cardiovascular disease, supporting the idea that an unfavorable metabolic profile may be beneficial in ALS and FTLD. The two most widely studied ALS/FTLD models, super-oxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and TAR DNA binding protein of 43 kDA (TDP-43), reveal metabolic dysfunction and a positive effect of metabolic strategies on disease onset and/or progression. In addition, molecular studies reveal a role for ALS/FTLD-associated proteins in the regulation of cellular and whole-body metabolism. Here, we systematically evaluate these observations and discuss how changes in cellular glucose/lipid metabolism may result in abnormal protein aggregations in ALS and FTLD, which may have important implications for new treatment strategies for ALS/FTLD and possibly other neurodegenerative conditions."

We reported a novel heterozygous insertion mutation that led to a frameshift and a premature termination at position 136 in exon 5 of the SOD1 gene (c.392_393insGCAAAGGTGG; p.N132Qfs*5) in a Chinese familial ALS pedigree. This mutation in the pedigree demonstrated an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and a phenotype characterized by an early onset (approximately 34\u00a0years old) with a relatively rapid course (approximately 2\u00a0years) and limb onset with respiratory involvement. The clinical feature of the p.N132Qfs*5 mutation was nearly identical to a previously reported mutation (Gly127insTGGG). Experiments in G127X mice demonstrated that the G127X mutation was pathogenic. SOD1 activity in the p.N132Qfs*5 mutation carriers in the family decreased significantly compared with normal family members.

Some 67 different mutations have been reported worldwide to date, comprising about one-fifth of familial ALS cases in the populations studied. The autosomal recessively inherited D90A CuZn-SOD mutation has been associated with a very slowly progressive, clinically distinct phenotype, and is neurophysiologically characterized by very slow central motor conduction. It is not known which physiological and/or biochemical mechanisms are responsible for the different clinical course. To delineate ALS associated with this particular CuZn-SOD mutation from ALS without mutations, we performed a detailed neurophysiological study of the corticomotoneuronal function using peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) in eight ALS patients homozygous for the D90A CuZn-SOD mutation. The results were compared with those obtained in 12 non-hereditary ALS patients and 11 healthy subjects. PSTHs were constructed from three to seven different, voluntarily recruited motor units of the extensor digitorum communis muscle (EDC) in each patient. The onset latency, number of excess bins, duration and synchrony of the primary peak were analysed. All measurements differed significantly between healthy controls and the D90A patients (P < 0.0007). The mean onset latency of the primary peak in D90A patients was 35.3 ms, compared with 24.2 ms for non-hereditary ALS patients and 19.3 ms for normal subjects (P < 0.0000). Delayed primary peaks in the D90A patients were desynchronized and characteristically preceded by a marked suppression phase. This suppression phase was not seen in non-hereditary ALS patients. We conclude that the mainly slow conducting and/or polysynaptic corticomotoneuronal connections are preserved in the D90A homozygous cases, and that the cortical and possibly spinal inhibitory circuitry is preserved. These events may partially protect the motor neurons, slowing down the degenerative process."

In most instances, sporadic and autosomal dominant familial ALS (FALS) are clinically similar. We have previously shown that in some but not all FALS pedigrees the disease is linked to a genetic defect on chromosome 21q (refs 8, 9). Here we report tight genetic linkage between FALS and a gene that encodes a cytosolic, Cu/Zn-binding superoxide dismutase (SOD1), a homodimeric metalloenzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of the toxic superoxide anion O2.- to O2 and H2O2 (ref. 10). Given this linkage and the potential role of free radical toxicity in other neurodenegerative disorders, we investigated SOD1 as a candidate gene in FALS.

Several studies have pointed to a variety of functions of mutant SOD1, which has enhanced catalytic activity of the peroxynitrite-mediated tyrosine nitration, readily releases the reactive Cu ions, induces apoptotic cell death, has enhanced peroxidase activity, damages the mitochondria to release Ca2+, and forms SOD1-containing aggregates in the cytoplasm. Many of these studies have obtained evidence for increased oxidative damage in ALS. On the other hand, some reports disagree with oxidative damage involvement in SOD1 mutant ALS. In considering the findings of increased oxidative damage in mutant SOD1-expressing transgenic mice, it should be remembered that overexpression of mutant SOD1 may enhance oxidative stress generation from this enzyme. In this review, we present the clinicopathological features of SOD1 mutant familial ALS and its transgenic mouse model, and also discuss SOD1 mutation-related neurotoxicity, including SOD1 protein aggregation and post-translational protein modification."

This paper shortly reviews the background for and the use of rodent transgenic models of ALS. Silencing the SOD-1 gene does not produce paralytic phenotype, but transgenic rodents expressing human mutated (hm) SOD-1 atop their own enzyme develop relatively selective and fatal degeneration of motoneurons. Many essential neuropathological and biochemical features of the paralytic disease in hmSOD-1 transgenic mice and rats are similar to human fALS, and these animals are currently considered a model of the human disease. Two types of hypotheses put forward to explain pathomechanism of motoneuron degeneration in hmSOD-1 transgenics (hence also in human ALS) are the \"gain of function\" hypotheses which assume that the mutated enzyme displays new toxic catalytic properties, and the \"gain of interaction\" hypotheses which assume that the mutated protein molecules are toxic because they became misfolded and undergo oligomerization. Transgenic animal models of ALS are used for preclinical assessments of new therapeutic approaches ranging from mono- and polipharmacotherapy to gene therapy and stem cell therapy."

We describe the identification and characterization of two mutations in this region, both found in mice. One mutation, a glutamate to lysine amino acid substitution was found in position 77 (E77K) of the strain SOD1/Ei distributed by the Jackson Laboratory. The other mutation, a lysine to glutamate substitution at position 70 (K70E) of a human transgene, was discovered in mouse line TgHS/SF-155. Enzyme activity measurements and heterodimer analysis of the CuZn SOD variant in SOD1/Ei suggest a mild loss of activity, which differs from the enzyme activity losses detected in patients with autosomal dominant ALS 1. Similarly, the presence of the mutant transgene in TgHS/SF 155 does not produce any phenotypic manifestations."

We have investigated the functional and structural effects of a Gly-->Ser mutation at codon 41 of SOD1 in a pedigree with FALS and the topography of SOD1 expression in the mammalian CNS. These analyses show that the 41Gly-->Ser mutation causes a 27% reduction in Cu, Zn SOD activity. SOD1 is transcribed at high levels in rat motoneurons and four other types of neurons homologous to upper motoneurons that degenerate in human ALS. However, SOD1 is transcribed at lower levels in other types of neurons, such as cerebellar Purkinje cells, which are not usually involved significantly in human ALS. On the other hand, immunocytochemical studies indicate that most types of rat neurons contain similar levels of Cu, Zn SOD immunoreactive protein. Nevertheless, these results suggest that the essential feature causing this subtype of ALS is either a reduction in Cu, Zn SOD activity in cell types that presumably critically require Cu, Zn SOD for protection against oxidative damage or the fact that the mutation in SOD1 associated with FALS results in a novel gain of function that is particularly deleterious to those cell types expressing SOD1 at high levels."

We confirm a recently reported ala4-->val mutation in exon 1 of the SOD1 gene and report that this mutation is both the most commonly detected of all SOD1 mutations and among the most clinically severe. By comparison with our other FALS families, the exon 1 mutation is associated with reduced survival time after onset: 1.2 years, as compared to 2.5 years for all other FALS patients. We also demonstrate that SOD1 is prominently expressed in normal motor neurons and that neural expression of SOD1 is not prevented by this exon 1 mutation. Assays of SOD1 enzymatic activity in extracts from red blood cells, lymphoblastoid cells, and brain tissues revealed an approximately 50% reduction in activity of cytosolic SOD1 in patients with this mutation compared to normal individuals. By contrast, patients with sporadic ALS had normal levels of SOD1 enzymatic activity. Why this SOD1 mutation causes motor neuron death in FALS remains to be established. While it may be that FALS is a consequence of loss of SOD1 function, it is also possible that motor neuron death in this dominantly inherited disease occurs because the mutations confer an additional, cytotoxic function on the SOD1 protein."

Ribosome concentration was normal in Duchenne and facioscapulohumeral and decreased in Becker muscular dystrophy. Distribution of ribosomes in sucrose density gradients showed abnormalities (sharp monosomal peak and fewer polyribosomes) only in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and was normal in the other two types. In-vitro amino-acid incorporation of ribosomes in Duchenne muscular dystrophy revealed high collagen and low noncollagen synthesis of the heavy polyribosomes. This abnormality is controlled by an undetermined enzymatic factor belonging to the soluble enzyme fraction. Supplementation of the dystrophic heavy polyribosomes with normal soluble enzymes restored the synthesis of collagen to that of the controls. Heavy polyribosomes extracted from normals or from carriers produce proportionately more collagen in the presence of soluble enzyme fraction from Duchenne muscular dystrophy than in the presence of their homologous enzymes. In Becker muscular dystrophy, both noncollagen and collagen synthesis of the heavy polyribosomes were increased, under the influence of ribosomal factors. The different protein synthesis in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies suggests that these conditions are non-allelic. In facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy the changes in protein synthesis occurred only in the early stage of the disease and consisted of increased noncollagen synthesis of the light polyribosomes, while the heavy polyribosomes had normal activity including collagen synthesis. This reaction was controlled by ribosomal factors."

The mean age of onset was 3.2 years and the mean age at presentation was 7.2 years. 110/120 cases were confirmed by genetic testing and six were by absence of staining for dystrophin on muscle biopsy. DMD gene deletion was present in 78.5%, duplication in 5.3% and point mutation in 11.2% cases. 70.3% of patients had deletion located at a distal hot spot region. Single exon deletion was found in 16.5%. Distal hotspot exons 47, 48 and 50 were the commonly deleted exons.\nCONCLUSIONS: In our study, 94.8% cases showed genetic change in the DMD gene. Muscle biopsy was the choice of investigation in earlier days. Detection of DMD by DNA based method eliminates the need to do an invasive procedure for diagnosis. Hence the genetic testing should be the investigation of choice in suspected cases of DMD.

Dystrophin expression was evaluated via immunostaining, Western blotting, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and droplet digital PCR in 9 muscle biopsies.\nRESULTS: The series comprised 57 subjects (23 index) expressing Becker phenotype (28%), isolated cardiopathy (19%), and asymptomatic features (53%). Cognitive impairment occurred in 90% of children. Patients were classified according to 10 distinct index-case breakpoints; 4 of them were recurrent due to founder events. A specific breakpoint (D5) was associated with severity, but no significant effect was appreciated due to the changes in intronic sequences. All biopsies showed dystrophin expression of >67% and traces of alternative del45-57 transcript that were not deemed pathogenically relevant. Only the LTBP4 haplotype appeared associated the presence of cardiopathy among the explored extragenic factors.\nINTERPRETATION: We confirmed that del45-55 segregates a high proportion of benign phenotypes, severe cases, and isolated cardiac and cognitive presentations. Although some influence of the intronic breakpoint position and the LTBP4 modifier may exist, the pathomechanisms responsible for the phenotypic variability remain largely unresolved.

The literature shows that about 30-40% of DMD subjects have intellectual disability. In males with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, neuropsychiatric disorders have also been observed: attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity, autism spectrum disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is not just a muscle disorder, but also a disease that affects the brain. The aim of the present study was to describe a case series of children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy that have also the presence of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). They have been assessed by means of standardized autism scales and the most appropriate psycho-educational treatment is herein discussed.\nMETHODS: In order to evaluate and identify the presence and intensity of autistic symptoms have been used the Childhood Autism Rating Scale and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule tools. Moreover, in order to assess the intelligence of subjects and their lower limb function, Wisch-R intelligence scale and Vignos function scale were used, respectively.\nRESULTS: Atypical behaviors included a preference for being alone, and selective interest in privileged objects used in a stereotyped manner, motor fretting, and attention instability were present in all children. By the administration of these scales was confirmed the presence of an autism spectrum disorders in all subjects.\nCONCLUSIONS: It is important for clinical practice to consider this association increased."

This study investigates disease incidence within an Australian model of cascade screening and evolving genetic diagnostic technologies. A retrospective population-based cohort study of all genetically and/or histopathologically confirmed males with DMD, born in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory was undertaken from 2002-2012. Cases were identified using state-wide molecular laboratory and clinical databases. The annual disease incidence and \"theoretically\" preventable cases were extrapolated over the study period. Proband genotype/phenotype, pedigree analysis, carrier-risk and extent of cascade screening were also determined. The cumulative incidence of disease was 19.7 per 100,000 male live births and 1 in 5076 live born males were diagnosed with DMD. Differences in disease incidence were not statistically different when compared between 2002-2007 and 2008-2012 (incidence rate ratio\u2009=\u20091.13, 95% CI 0.76-1.69, p\u2009=\u20090.52). The incidence rate ratio of theoretically preventable cases did not significantly change between 2002-2007 and 2008-2012 (incidence rate ratio\u2009=\u20092.07, 95% CI 0.58-9.21, p\u2009=\u20090.23). Current diagnostic and cascade screening models have limitations in their impact on disease incidence, due to a spectrum of logistical, patient and condition related factors. Innovative approaches to reduce DMD incidence may be better achieved by preconception or early pregnancy carrier screening, prenatal exome sequencing and newborn screening."

The gene responsible for the Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy phenotype is located at Xp21 and its 427 kD protein product is called dystrophin. Deletions, point mutations and rarely duplications can occur almost anywhere in the DMD gene, which makes the molecular diagnosis difficult. Multiple polymerase chain reactions detect 95% of deletions in affected males [2, 4], but are not suitable for carrier detection in female relatives. Southern-blot analysis with six different cDNA probes covers the whole 14 kb dystrophin transcript and allows the detection of female carriers by comparing the intensity of the signals corresponding to the different exons. This method is time consuming compared to the newly introduced multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification method. Multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification is a method suitable for relative quantification of several DNA sequences in one reaction. The authors report results on 93 cases where the carrier status was analysed simultaneously by cDNA hybridisation and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification technique. In 42 cases the carrier state was confirmed and in this carrier population the authors additionally detected two cases with duplication, two cases with one copy of the whole dystrophin gene and three manifest carrier females. On the basis of these results the MLPA technique, which has been newly introduced in Hungary, proved to be a sensitive and quick method for the detection of carrier state in the DMD/BMD disease. Moreover, the exact deletion or duplication border can be detected and as a result, prediction on the phenotype can be given. This will provide the right therapeutic intervention for the affected patients in the future."

Recent availability in treatment for DMD raised the need of early diagnosis, and DMD became as a selective item of newborn screening (NBS) since Feb. 2021 in our center.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Dried blood spots (DBS) muscle-type creatine kinase (CK) isoform was measured with a commercialized kit with age-adjusted cutoffs. Subjects with an elevation of CK in the first screen were requested for a re-screen 2 weeks later. A DBS whole-exome sequencing (WES) panel for dystrophin and other neuromuscular-related genes was applied to confirm the diagnosis for subjects with persistent hyperCKemia.\nRESULTS: During a 1-year period, 50,572 newborns (male 26,130) received DMD screening at a mean age of 2 days (SD 1 day). Among them, 632 (1.2%) had an elevated CK value. A re-screen at a mean age of 14 days (SD 8 days) revealed 14 subjects with persistent hyperCKemia, and DMD was confirmed in 3 of them. The incidence of DMD in Taiwan was 1:8,710 (95% CI 1 in 2,963 to 1 in 25,610) live birth males. Results of DMD DBS also assisted in Pompe newborn screening.\nCONCLUSIONS: NBS for DMD enables earlier management of the disease. The high re-screening rate could potentially be waived by moving the DBS WES assay to a second-tier test. The long-term benefit and the impact of newborn screening on the prognosis of DMD, however, remain further elucidated."

The common incidence of all three types of spinal muscular atrophy was 1 in 5631 liveborn children (most frequent was the Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, type I--1 in 12,286). This fact confirms, that this disease belongs to the most frequent autosomal recessive diseases in children of our region too.

Despite this, carrier detection still poses a problem in some cases, because of the enormous size of the gene and the lack of sufficient numbers of informative markers. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of two additional microsatellite markers (IVS44SK12 and IVS44SK21) in intron 44 of the dystrophin gene.

Almost all cases of HAE are caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene resulting in a deficiency in functional plasma C1 esterase inhibitor (C1EI), a serine protease inhibitor that normally inhibits proteases in the contact, complement, and fibrinolytic systems. Current treatment of HAE includes long-term prophylaxis with attenuated androgens or human plasma-derived C1EI and management of acute attacks with human plasma-derived or recombinant C1EI, bradykinin, and kallikrein inhibitors, each of which requires repeated administration. As an approach to effectively treat HAE with a single treatment, we hypothesized that a one-time intravenous administration of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene transfer vector expressing the genetic sequence of the normal human C1 esterase inhibitor (AAVrh.10hC1EI) would provide sustained circulating C1EI levels sufficient to prevent angioedema episodes.\nMETHODS: To study the efficacy of AAVrh.10hC1EI, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to create a heterozygote C1EI-deficient mouse model (S63\u00b1) that shares characteristics associated with HAE in humans including decreased plasma C1EI and C4 levels. Phenotypically, these mice have increased vascular permeability of skin and internal organs.\nRESULTS: Systemic administration of AAVrh.10hC1EI to the S63\u00b1 mice resulted in sustained human C1EI activity levels above the predicted therapeutic levels and correction of the vascular leak in skin and internal organs.\nCONCLUSION: A single treatment with AAVrh.10hC1EI has the potential to provide long-term protection from angioedema attacks in affected individuals."

In 2009, a study from the Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance, Tracking, and Research Network (MD STARnet) showed an average diagnosis age of 5\u2009years among males with DMD born from January 1, 1982 to December 31, 2000. Initiatives were implemented by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and patient organizations to reduce time to diagnosis. We conducted a follow-up study in a surveillance cohort born after January 1, 2000 to determine whether there has been an improvement in time to diagnosis.\nMETHODS: We assessed the age of diagnosis among males with DMD born from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2015 using data collected by six US MD STARnet surveillance sites (Colorado, Iowa, western New York State, the Piedmont region of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Utah). The analytic cohort included 221 males with definite or probable DMD diagnosis without a documented family history. We computed frequency count and percentage for categorical variables, and mean, median, and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables.\nRESULTS: The mean [median] ages in years of diagnostic milestones were: first signs, 2.7 [2.0]; first creatine kinase (CK), 4.6 [4.6]; DNA/muscle biopsy testing, 4.9 [4.8]; and time from first signs to diagnostic confirmation, 2.2 [1.4].\nDISCUSSION: The time interval between first signs of DMD and diagnosis remains unchanged at 2.2\u2009years. This results in lost opportunities for timely genetic counseling, implementation of standards of care, initiation of glucocorticoids, and participation in clinical trials."

Two forms of onset of DMD: Retarded development and locomotion problems were found, confirming other studies. The mean age of onset of symptoms for 22 patients was 2.4 years.

These attacks are mediated by excessive bradykinin production, as a result of uncontrolled activation of the plasma kallikrein/kinin system, which is caused by a C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency or dysfunction in HAE types 1 and 2, respectively. For many years, treatment options were limited to therapies with substantial adverse effects, insufficient efficacy, or difficult routes of administration. Increased insights in the pathophysiology of HAE have paved the way for the development of new therapies with fewer side effects. In the last two decades, several targeted novel therapeutic strategies for HAE have been developed, for both long-term prophylaxis and on demand treatment of acute attacks. This article reviews the advances in the development of more effective and convenient treatment options for HAE and their anticipated effects on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. The emergence of these improved treatment options will presumably change current HAE guidelines, but adherence to these recommendations may become restricted by high treatment costs. It will therefore be essential to determine the indications and identify the patients that will benefit most from these newest treatment generations. Ultimately, current preclinical research into gene therapies may eventually lead the way towards curative treatment options for HAE. In conclusion, an increasing shift towards the use of highly effective long-term prophylaxis is anticipated, which should drastically abate the burden on patients with hereditary angioedema."

They were asked to record their time to first response and complete resolution following the treatment. This cohort included our most severely affected and difficult to treat patients.\nRESULTS: In most cases, time to first improvement following rhC1INH and complete resolution was recorded as comparable to their typical response to pdC1INH, although 4/11 patients reported that the time to first improvement was much quicker than their average pdC1INH response. Five of the 11 patients continued with rhC1INH as their preferred rescue treatment. Of those who chose not to continue the treatment, four reported a recurrence or early return of symptoms with rhC1INH.\nCONCLUSION: In our experience, rhC1INH is a beneficial treatment for patients with preference for a C1INH that is not plasma derived and it is suitable for home treatment. In some cases it demonstrates cost saving, especially for heavier patients who require higher doses. In some patients rhC1INH may result in faster resolution of symptoms.

In 87 patients the operation was carried out during early restrictions of the lower limb joint mobility at an average age of 6.56 years (4.02-8.26, SD 1.42). The follow-up was on average 5.4 years (0.25-9.01, SD 2.7). This group was compared to a control group (natural history) consisting of 100 non-operated DMD patients. A significant (P < 0.001) release of the contractures could be obtained. Loss of walking ability occurred in the control group at an average of 9.29 years (5.85-13.63, SD 1.98) and in the operated group at an average of 10.55 years (8.17-14.39, SD 1.76). This shows that early lower limb surgery leads to a prolongation of independent ambulation of 1.25 years on average. In contrast to the patients of the control group all treated patients between ages 6 and 8 years could walk independently. The positive influence of early lower limb surgery could also be shown by the development of Hammersmith motor ability score, CIDD (Council of Investigation of Duchenne Dystrophy) grading and Vignos scale. Nevertheless, in consideration of the well-known course of DMD not only the prolongation of ambulation but also the achieved prolongation of assisted standing ability with no or mild contractures are aims of lower limb surgery. Since no improvement of muscle strength could be observed after lower limb surgery, further studies have to investigate if additionally administered steroids can prolong ambulation after early lower limb surgery."

Ltbp4, encoding latent transforming growth factor-\u03b2 binding protein 4, was previously discovered in a genome-wide scan as a modifier of murine muscular dystrophy. We sought to determine whether LTBP4 genotype influenced DMD severity in a large patient cohort.\nMETHODS: We analyzed nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from human LTBP4 in 254 nonambulatory subjects with known DMD mutations. These SNPs, V194I, T787A, T820A, and T1140M, form the VTTT and IAAM LTBP4 haplotypes.\nRESULTS: Individuals homozygous for the IAAM LTBP4 haplotype remained ambulatory significantly longer than those heterozygous or homozygous for the VTTT haplotype. Glucocorticoid-treated patients who were IAAM homozygotes lost ambulation at 12.5 \u00b1 3.3 years compared to 10.7 \u00b1 2.1 years for treated VTTT heterozygotes or homozygotes. IAAM fibroblasts exposed to transforming growth factor (TGF) \u03b2 displayed reduced phospho-SMAD signaling compared to VTTT fibroblasts, consistent with LTBP4' role as a regulator of TGF\u03b2.\nINTERPRETATION: LTBP4 haplotype influences age at loss of ambulation, and should be considered in the management of DMD patients."

This male patient was diagnosed with DMD at age of 2. He has been treated with daily steroids since age 7 years. He lost the ability to arise from the floor and walk up steps at age 14 and lost ambulation by age 16. He was fitted with orthoses at age 16 following surgical correction of his lower extremity contractures and regained independent ambulation.

This advisory board was sponsored by PTC Therapeutics, the distributers of the substance ataluren.\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Loss of ambulation is heterogeneously defined across clinical trials. Among others, the need of a\u00a0wheelchair, ambulation without mobility aids or maximum walking distance can be suitable parameters for assessment. Treatment of DMD patients at any stage of the disease is based on supportive and symptomatic measures, which should be continued after loss of ambulation. In addition, disease-modifying drugs are available for the treatment of DMD and glucocorticoids are the usual standard of care treatment even beyond the loss of ambulation. Ataluren, a\u00a0potentially dystrophin restorative, disease-modifying treatment, has been approved for patients with DMD due to a\u00a0nonsense mutation (nmDMD), which applies to approximately 13% of DMD patients and is usually combined with steroids. Clinical data from the STRIDE registry demonstrated a\u00a0delayed disease progression even after loss of ambulation. Currently, no reliable data are available for exon skipping approaches in adult DMD patients. The antioxidant idebenone could be an option in nonambulant adolescent patients not treated with glucocorticoids and without other therapeutic options. A\u00a0combination treatment of idebenone and glucocorticoids is currently being investigated in a\u00a0clinical trial. Add-on treatment with idebenone in addition to ataluren may be considered for nonambulant nmDMD patients. Some of the discussed treatment options are still in clinical trials or there are not enough data for older DMD patients; therefore, these expert recommendations correspond to evidence class\u00a0IV."

Novel pharmacological agents targeting the genetic defects and disease mechanisms are becoming available; however, corticosteroid (CS) therapy remains the standard of care.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this longitudinal study was to elucidate the effect of CS therapy on the rate of muscle strength and gross motor skill decline in boys with DMD and assess the sensitivity of selected outcome measures.\nMETHODS: Eighty-four ambulatory boys with DMD (49-180 months), 70 on CS, 14 corticosteroid na\u00efve (NCS), participated in this 8-year multi-site study. Outcomes included; isokinetic dynamometry, the Standing (STD) and Walking/Running/jumping (WRJ) dimensions of the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM), and Timed Function Tests (TFTs). Nonlinear mixed modeling procedures determined the rate of change with age and the influence of steroids.\nRESULTS: Despite CS therapy the rate of decline in strength with age was significant in all muscle groups assessed. CS therapy significantly slowed decline in knee extensor strength, as the NCS group declined at 3x the rate of the CS group. Concurrently, WRJ skills declined in the NCS group at twice the rate of the CS group. 4-stair climb and 10 meter walk/run performance was superior in the boys on CS therapy.\nCONCLUSION: CS therapy slowed the rate of muscle strength decline and afforded longer retention of select gross motor skills in boys on CS compared to boys who were NCS. Isokinetic dynamometry, Walk/Run/Jump skills, and select TFTs may prove informative in assessing the efficacy of new therapeutics in ambulatory boys with DMD."

Functional improvement was not significant, including loss of gait, probably because this loss also depends on an increase in joint contracture.

To fully characterize the natural history, it is crucial to obtain appropriate estimates of the life expectancy and mortality rates of patients with DMD.\nMETHODS: A systematic review of the published literature on mortality in DMD up to July 2020 was undertaken, specifically focusing on publications in which Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves with age as a timescale were presented. These were digitized, and individual patient data (IPD) were reconstructed. The pooled IPD were analyzed with the KM estimator and parametric survival analysis models. Estimates were also stratified by birth cohort.\nRESULTS: Of 1,177 articles identified, 14 publications met the inclusion criteria and provided data on 2,283 patients, of whom 1,049 had died. Median life expectancy was 22.0 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 21.2, 22.4). Analyses stratified by 3 time periods in which patients were born showed markedly increased life expectancy in more recent patient populations; patients born after 1990 have a median life expectancy of 28.1 years (95% CI 25.1, 30.3).\nDISCUSSION: This article presents a full overview of mortality across the lifetime of a patient with DMD and highlights recent improvements in survival. In the absence of large-scale prospective cohort studies or trials reporting mortality data for patients with DMD, extraction of IPD from the literature provides a viable alternative to estimating life expectancy for this patient population."

It is potentially fatal, particularly if not identified at an early stage. Apart from androgens, which are contraindicated in children and in pregnant women, a range of effective, albeit very expensive treatments have recently become available for HAE patients. The cost of these new treatments is beyond the reach of most developing countries. At this time, there is no cure for the disorder. In spite of mutations of the SERPING1 gene, autoimmunity and infections are not prominent features of the condition. Here, we present the argument that HAE should be viewed primarily as a metabolic liver disorder. This conceptual paradigm shift will stimulate basic research and may facilitate new therapeutic approaches to HAE outlined in this paper. We suggest several novel potential treatment options for HAE from the perspectives of clinical immunology, molecular biology, and liver transplantation. Many of these offer the prospect of curing the disorder. The effectiveness of these options is rapidly improving in many cases, and their risks are decreasing. Given the very high costs of treating HAE, some of these curative options may become feasible in the next decade."

Its product is involved in various cellular processes, including cytoplasmic assembly of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, pre-mRNA processing and activation of transcription. Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress (SMARD) is clinically and genetically distinct from SMA. Here we demonstrate that SMARD type 1 (SMARD1) results from mutations in the gene encoding immunoglobulin micro-binding protein 2 (IGHMBP2; on chromosome 11q13.2-q13.4). In six SMARD1 families, we detected three recessive missense mutations (exons 5, 11 and 12), two nonsense mutations (exons 2 and 5), one frameshift deletion (exon 5) and one splice donor-site mutation (intron 13). Mutations in mouse Ighmbp2 (ref. 14) have been shown to be responsible for spinal muscular atrophy in the neuromuscular degeneration (nmd) mouse, whose phenotype resembles the SMARD1 phenotype. Like the SMN1 product, IGHMBP2 colocalizes with the RNA-processing machinery in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Our results show that IGHMBP2 is the second gene found to be defective in spinal muscular atrophy, and indicate that IGHMBP2 and SMN share common functions important for motor neuron maintenance and integrity in mammals."

The primary cause of most, if not all, forms of childhood-onset spinal muscular atrophy appears to be the homozygous loss of the telomeric copy of the survival motor neuron (SMNT) gene. It is interesting that approximately half of all affected patients are likewise homozygous nulls for the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) gene and a somewhat lesser fraction for the basal transcription factor, p44 subunit (BTF2p44) gene. It has been proposed that homozygous loss of SMNT is the primary cause of spinal muscular atrophy while the loss of NAIP and perhaps other genes primarily affects the severity of disease manifestation. We explored this hypothesis by evaluating the extent of gene deletions in three multigenerational families with spinal muscular atrophy exhibiting dramatic intrafamilial phenotypic variation. Using somatic cell hybrid lines to sequester individual spinal muscular atrophy homologues, we show that homologues missing several contiguous genes correlate with \"severe\" disease alleles and homologues missing only SMNT correlate with \"mild\" disease alleles. These observations support the hypothesis that phenotypic severity among the childhood-onset spinal muscular atrophies is directly correlated with the extent of disease-specific deletions."

SMN is ubiquitous and deficient levels cause spinal cord motoneurons (MNs) degeneration and muscle atrophy. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which SMN reduction in muscle contributes to SMA disease is not fully understood. Therefore, studies evaluating atrophy mechanisms in SMA muscles will contribute to strengthening current knowledge of the pathology. Here we propose to evaluate autophagy in SMA muscle, a pathway altered in myotube atrophy. We analized autophagy proteins and mTOR in muscle biopsies, fibroblasts, and lymphoblast cell lines from SMA patients and in gastrocnemius muscles from a severe SMA mouse model. Human MNs differentiated from SMA and unaffected control iPSCs were also included in the analysis of the autophagy. Muscle biopsies, fibroblasts, and lymphoblast cell lines from SMA patients showed reduction of the autophagy marker LC3-II. In SMA mouse gastrocnemius, we observed lower levels of LC3-II, Beclin 1, and p62/SQSTM1 proteins at pre-symptomatic stage. mTOR phosphorylation at Ser2448 was decreased in SMA muscle cells. However, in mouse and human cultured SMA MNs mTOR phosphorylation and LC3-II levels were increased. These results suggest a differential regulation in SMA of the autophagy process in muscle cells and MNs. Opposite changes in autophagy proteins and mTOR phosphorylation between muscle cells and neurons were observed. These differences may reflect a specific\u00a0response to SMN reduction, which could imply diverse tissue-dependent reactions to therapies that should be taken into account when treating SMA patients."

Respiratory failure causes death in SMA but the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. The zinc finger protein ZPR1 interacts with SMN. ZPR1 is down regulated in SMA patients. We report that ZPR1 functions downstream of SMN to regulate HoxA5 levels in phrenic motor neurons that control respiration. Spatiotemporal inactivation of Zpr1 gene in motor neurons down-regulates HoxA5 and causes defects in the function of phrenic motor neurons that results in respiratory failure and perinatal lethality in mice. Modulation in ZPR1 levels directly correlates and influences levels of HoxA5 transcription. In SMA mice, SMN-deficiency causes down-regulation of ZPR1 and HoxA5 that result in degeneration of phrenic motor neurons. Identification of ZPR1 and HoxA5 as potential targets provides a paradigm for developing strategies to treat respiratory distress in SMA."

Homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene accounts for 95% of all affected SMA patients. A highly homologous gene survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) compensates weakly with the loss of SMN1 and its copy number correlates with disease severity.\nMETHODS: We report here the MS-CNV method combining competitive PCR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for simultaneous quantification of SMN1, SMN2 and NAIP dosages. For both SMN1 and SMN2, the exon 7 and exon 8 were analyzed. MS-CNV was validated with parallel analysis by a commercial MLPA assay in two independent cohorts.\nRESULTS: In the first cohort of 79 blood samples containing 3 SMA patients and 5 carriers, MS-CNV results were highly concordant with MLPA analysis for the copy numbers of SMN1, SMN2 and NAIP. In the second independent and blinded cohort of 62 blood samples containing 21 SMA patients and 14 carriers, MS-CNV results were also highly concordant with MLPA. Both MS-CNV and MLPA quantified SMN1 dosages without ambiguity.\nCONCLUSIONS: MS-CNV can be used for carrier screening and genetic diagnosis of SMA, providing dosages information for both SMN1 and SMN2 given its accuracy and high sample processing throughput by mass spectrometric analysis."

Three treatments that increase SMN expression by distinct molecular mechanisms, administration routes and tissue biodistributions have received regulatory approval with others in clinical development.

Humans typically have one or more copies of the SMN2 gene, the coding region of which is nearly identical to SMN1, except that a point mutation causes splicing out of exon 7 and production of a largely nonfunctional SMNDelta7 protein. The development of drugs that mitigate aberrant SMN2 splicing is an attractive therapeutic approach for SMA. A steric block antisense oligonucleotide (AO) has recently been developed that blocked an intronic splice suppressor element, and enhanced SMN2 exon 7 inclusion in SMA patient fibroblasts. Here, we show that periodic intracerebroventricular (ICV) delivery of this AO resulted in increased SMN expression in brain and spinal cord to as much as 50% of the level of healthy littermates. Real-time PCR of SMN2 transcripts confirmed the AO-mediated increase in full-length SMN. The AO-derived increase in SMN expression led to a concomitant improvement in bodyweight throughout the lifespan of the SMA animals. Treatment of SMA mice with AO also provided partial correction of motor deficits, manifest as improved righting response. Injections of a scrambled oligonucleotide had no effect on SMN expression or phenotype in the SMA mice. Our results validate that AOs that abrogate aberrant splicing of SMN2 are promising compounds for treating SMA."

SMA type 4 (SMA4) is an adult onset, less severe form of SMA for which genetic and pathogenic causes remain elusive.Whole exome sequencing in a 30-year-old brother and sister with SMA4 identified a compound heterozygous mutation (p.

G492R/p. F610C mutation, we demonstrate reduced levels of CAPN1 protein and protease activity. Functional characterization of the SMA4 fibroblasts revealed no changes in SMN protein levels and subcellular distribution. Additional cellular pathways associated with SMA remain unaffected in the patient fibroblasts, highlighting the tissue specificity of CAPN1 dysfunction in SMA4 pathophysiology. This study provides genetic and functional evidence of CAPN1 as a novel gene for the SMA4 phenotype and expands the phenotype of CAPN1 mutation disorders."

SMA is a monogenic pathology that originates from the loss of the SMN1 gene in most cases or mutations in rare cases. Interestingly, several SMN1 mutations occur within the TUDOR methylarginine reader domain of SMN. We hypothesized that in SMN1 mutant cases, SMA may emerge from aberrant protein-protein interactions between SMN and key neuronal factors. Using a BioID proteomic approach, we have identified and validated a number of SMN-interacting proteins, including fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) family members (FMR<sub>FM</sub>). Importantly, SMA-linked SMN<sub>TUDOR</sub> mutant forms (SMN<sub>ST</sub>) failed to interact with FMR<sub>FM</sub> In agreement with the recent work, we define biochemically that SMN forms droplets in vitro and these droplets are stabilized by RNA, suggesting that SMN could be involved in the formation of membraneless organelles, such as Cajal nuclear bodies. Finally, we found that SMN and FMRP co-fractionate with polysomes, in an RNA-dependent manner, suggesting a potential role in localized translation in motor neurons."

In December 2016, nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide drug, was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of SMA, and in July 2018, SMA was added to the recommended uniform screening panel, a list of conditions that all states are encouraged to include in their newborn screening (NBS) panels. In this review, we begin with a brief clinical history of the diagnosis of SMA, discuss the current SMA clinical classification system, describe the current treatment, and discuss evolving treatment guidelines. We then discuss the path to include SMA in NBS programs as well as the controversies it engenders because the variability in age at symptom onset means early identification of asymptomatic patients who will not require therapy for years or decades. We also consider alternate population screening opportunities. Next, we consider experimental treatments. We conclude by supporting NBS for SMA with the caveat that a long-term follow-up registry is ethically essential to ensure that the benefits outweigh the harms for all screened infants, including those with milder and/or later-onset forms of SMA."

Our aim is to highlight how mitochondrial defects may contribute to disease progression and how restoring mitochondrial functionality may be a promising approach to develop new therapies. We also collected from previous studies a list of transcripts encoding mitochondrial proteins affected in various SMA models. Moreover, we speculate that in adulthood, when motor neurons require only very low SMN levels, the natural deterioration of mitochondria associated with aging may be a crucial triggering factor for adult spinal muscular atrophy, and this requires particular attention for therapeutic strategies."

SMA is characterized by motoneuron death, skeletal muscle denervation and atrophy. Disease severity inversely correlates with copy number of a second gene (SMN2), which harbors a splicing defect that causes the production of inadequate levels of functional SMN protein. Small molecules that modify SMN2 splicing towards increased production of functional SMN significantly ameliorate SMA phenotypes in mouse models of severe SMA. At suboptimal doses, splicing modifiers, such as SMN-C1, have served to generate mice that model milder SMA, referred to as pharmacological SMA mice, which survive into early adulthood. Nerve sprouting at endplates, known as terminal sprouting, is key to normal muscle fiber reinnervation following nerve injury and its promotion might mitigate neuromuscular symptoms in mild SMA. Sprouting has been difficult to study in severe SMA mice due to their short lifespan. Here, we show that pharmacological SMA mice are capable of terminal sprouting following reinnervation that is largely SMN-C1 dose-independent, but that they display a reinnervation delay that is critically SMN-C1 dose-dependent. Data also suggest that SMN-C1 can induce by itself a limited terminal sprouting response in SMA and wild-type normally-innervated endplates."

A highly homologous copy gene (SMN2) is retained in almost all SMA patients but fails to generate adequate levels of SMN protein due to its defective splicing pattern. The severity of the SMA phenotype is inversely correlated with SMN2 copy number and the level of full-length SMN protein produced by SMN2 ( approximately 10-15% compared with SMN1). The natural history of SMA has been altered over the past several decades, primarily through supportive care measures, but an effective treatment does not presently exist.

SMN is ubiquitously expressed, but the mechanisms underlying predominant neuron degeneration in SMA are poorly understood. We report that chronic low levels of SMN cause Senataxin (SETX)-deficiency, which results in increased RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and deficiency of DNA-activated protein kinase-catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), which impairs DSB repair. Consequently, DNA damage accumulates in patient cells, SMA mice neurons and patient spinal cord tissues. In dividing cells, DSBs are repaired by homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways, but neurons predominantly use NHEJ, which relies on DNA-PKcs activity. In SMA dividing cells, HR repairs DSBs and supports cellular proliferation. In SMA neurons, DNA-PKcs-deficiency causes defects in NHEJ-mediated repair leading to DNA damage accumulation and neurodegeneration. Restoration of SMN levels rescues SETX and DNA-PKcs deficiencies and DSB accumulation in SMA neurons and patient cells. Moreover, SETX overexpression in SMA neurons reduces R-loops and DNA damage, and rescues neurodegeneration. Our findings identify combined deficiency of SETX and DNA-PKcs stemming downstream of SMN as an underlying cause of DSBs accumulation, genomic instability and neurodegeneration in SMA and suggest SETX as a potential therapeutic target for SMA."

Although SMN is ubiquitously expressed, spinal motor neurons are one of the most affected cell types. Previous studies have identified pathways uniquely activated in SMA motor neurons, including a hyperactivated ER stress pathway, neuronal hyperexcitability, and defective spliceosomes. To investigate why motor neurons are more affected than other neural types, we developed a spinal organoid model of SMA. We demonstrate overt motor neuron degeneration in SMA spinal organoids, and this degeneration can be prevented using a small molecule inhibitor of CDK4/6, indicating that spinal organoids are an ideal platform for therapeutic discovery."

SMN1 produces SMN, a ubiquitously expressed protein, that is essential for the development and survival of motor neurons. Major advances and developments in SMA therapeutics are shifting the natural history of the disease. With three relatively new available therapies, nusinersen (Spinraza), onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma), and risdiplam (Evrysdi), patients survive longer and have improved outcomes. However, patients and families continue to face many challenges associated with use of these therapies, including poor treatment response and a variability in the benefits to those that do respond, suggesting that the quest for the SMA cure is not over. In this review, we discuss the current therapies, their limitations, and highlight necessary gaps that need to be addressed to guarantee the best outcomes for SMA patients."

All the patients received glucocorticoids with or without tacrolimus for immunosuppression to decrease the risk of vector-related immune responses. After 26 weeks, patients were enrolled in a long-term follow-up study. The primary end points were safety and efficacy, as assessed by factor IX levels at week 26.\nRESULTS: Ten patients received one of four FLT180a doses of vector genomes (vg) per kilogram of body weight: 3.84\u00d71011 vg, 6.40\u00d71011 vg, 8.32\u00d71011 vg, or 1.28\u00d71012 vg. After receiving the infusion, all the patients had dose-dependent increases in factor IX levels. At a median follow-up of 27.2 months (range, 19.1 to 42.4), sustained factor IX activity was observed in all the patients except one, who resumed factor IX prophylaxis. As of the data-cutoff date (September 20, 2021), five patients had normal factor IX levels (range, 51 to 78%), three patients had levels from 23 to 43%, and one had a level of 260%. Of the reported adverse events, approximately 10% were related to FLT180a and 24% to immunosuppression. Increases in liver aminotransferase levels were the most common FLT180a-related adverse events. Late increases in aminotransferase levels occurred in patients who had received prolonged tacrolimus beyond the glucocorticoid taper. A serious adverse event of arteriovenous fistula thrombosis occurred in the patient with high factor IX levels.\nCONCLUSIONS: Sustained factor IX levels in the normal range were observed with low doses of FLT180a but necessitated immunosuppression with glucocorticoids with or without tacrolimus.

Its estimated incidence is 1:40,000 - 1:77,000 liveborn infants a year. LS is a rare progressive multisystem fatal disorder inherited by autosomal recessive, X-linked and maternal transmission. Clinical onset is predominantly in the first two years of life (average: six months); 50% of patients die within a year, even though there are later- and even adult-onset forms with a more protracted evolution. LS is due to a deficit of various respiratory chain and Krebs cycle enzymes resulting in insufficient production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), in particular cytochrome-c-oxidase (COX), pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and complex I of the respiratory chain, which share an autosomal recessive and X-linked mode of transmission. Cases with maternal inheritance (MILS) are due to a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) point mutation. LS is clinically heterogeneous in relation to the severity of the metabolic dysfunction and is characterized by muscle involvement and especially CNS disorders, particularly psychomotor retardation, ocular symptoms, hypotonia and pyramidal signs. Death is most commonly due to respiratory failure, status epilepticus and sudden coma. The major neuropathological findings, first described by Leigh in 1951, are symmetrical foci of spongy necrosis associated with vessel proliferation and reactive gliosis in basal nuclei, brainstem and thalamus grey matter. The neuronal metabolic alteration can also affect the white matter, resulting in delayed myelination or hypomyelination. The diagnosis rests on clinical signs, elevated CSF lactate, pyruvate and alanine, and biochemical and neuroradiological data. We describe two patients with LS studied with morphological MR associated with diffusion and spectroscopy techniques to assess the diagnostic potential of standard MR imaging and establish whether the association of functional MR methods can improve its diagnostic accuracy. A case of LS with a post-mortem MR study is also described. Three patients with a diagnosis of LS based on clinical, CSF and laboratory data were studied on a GE SIGNA EXCITE 1.5 T unit using an eight-channel phased-array head coil to acquire standard sequences (SE T1; TSE DP T2; FLAIR) and echo-planar diffusion-weighted sequences (DWI; b= 1000 s/mm2) with calculation of ADC maps. The spectroscopic study used single-voxel (TE/TR ms = 144/1500) and multi-voxel techniques (TE/TR ms = 144/1000) at the level of the basal nuclei. Bilateral and symmetrical involvement of basal nuclei grey matter with T2 hyperintensity was a consistent finding in the morphological MR study. In one patient, associated white matter involvement with T2 hyperintensity in periventricular and retrotrigonal areas reflected delayed myelination or hypomyelination. The deep grey matter changes, sometimes associated with white matter lesions, suggested a diagnosis of subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy, in line with the literature. Acute-phase ADC values in affected areas were lower than those of normal grey and white matter and displayed signal hyperintensity on DWI. Reduced ADC values are associated with restricted water diffusivity typical of cytotoxic edema. Spectroscopy showed a high lactate peak, reflecting altered anaerobic glycolysis, and a reduced NAA peak in affected areas, which are however non-specific findings. The most informative study in these patients is standard MR associated with functional techniques, which can confirm the diagnosis obtained with morphological imaging."

Most patients present with symptoms between the ages of three and twelve months, but adult onset Leigh syndrome has also been described. The disease course is characterized by a rapid deterioration of cognitive and motor functions, in most cases resulting in death due to respiratory failure. Despite the high genetic heterogeneity of Leigh syndrome, patients present with identical, symmetrical lesions in the basal ganglia or brainstem on MRI, while additional clinical manifestations and age of onset varies from case to case. To date, mutations in over 60 genes, both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA encoded, have been shown to cause Leigh syndrome, still explaining only half of all cases. In most patients, these mutations directly or indirectly affect the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain or pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Exome sequencing has accelerated the discovery of new genes and pathways involved in Leigh syndrome, providing novel insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms. This is particularly important as no general curative treatment is available for this devastating disorder, although several recent studies imply that early treatment might be beneficial for some patients depending on the gene or process affected. Timely, gene-based personalized treatment may become an important strategy in rare, genetically heterogeneous disorders like Leigh syndrome, stressing the importance of early genetic diagnosis and identification of new genes/pathways. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the most important clinical manifestations and genes/pathways involved in Leigh syndrome, and discuss the current state of therapeutic interventions in patients."

In this short report, we blocked FOXRED1 gene with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using C57bl/6 mice. Results showed neurobehavioral changes in the injected mice along with parallel degeneration in corpus striatum and sparing of the substantia nigra similar to what happen in Leigh syndrome cases. FOXRED1 blockage could serve as a new animal model for Leigh syndrome due to defective CI, which echoes damage to corpus striatum and affection of the central dopaminergic system in this disease. Further preclinical studies are required to validate this model."

Adulthood-onset SMA (SMA type 4) is rare, with few isolated cases reported. The objective of the present study was to describe a cohort of patients with SMA type 4.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to characterize clinical, genetic, radiological and neurophysiological features of patients with adulthood-onset SMA. Correlation analysis of functional assessment with genetic, radiological and neurophysiological data was performed.\nRESULTS: Twenty patients with SMA type 4 were identified in a Brazilian cohort of 227 patients with SMA. The most common clinical symptom was limb-girdle muscle weakness, observed in 15 patients (75%). The most frequent neurological findings were absent tendon reflexes in 18 (90%) and fasciculations in nine patients (45%). Sixteen patients (80%) had the homozygous deletion of exon 7 in the SMN1 gene, with 12 patients (60%) showing four copies of the SMN2 gene. The functional scales Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale Revised, Revised Upper Limb Module and Spinal Muscular Atrophy Functional Rating Scale, as well as the six-minute walk and the Time Up and Go tests showed a correlation with duration of disease. Motor Unit Number Index was correlated both with duration of disease and with performance in functional assessment. Radiological studies exhibited a typical pattern, with involvement of biceps femoris short head and gluteus minimus in all patients.\nCONCLUSION: This study represents the largest cohort of patients with SMA type 4 and provides functional, genetic, radiological and neurophysiological features that can be used as potential biomarkers for the new specific genetic therapies for SMA."

Now we examined 7 cases of type I and 9 cases of type II on clinical and histochemical ground. Of the total of 16 cases, 5 cases had a family history of the disease. (1) In type I, three were males and 4 females. The onset was within 30 days and the disease was manifest before or at delivery in 3 cases. The progression was so severe. All cases were dead by 10 months. They showed generalized hypotonia, abnormal respiration and could not sit without support. In type II, five were males and 4 females. The onset of the disease was between the age of 3 and 15 months. The progression was slow. All patients couldn't walk by themselves at all but 7 of them had abilities to sit without support. Clinically it was easy to classify type I from type II. (2) The most characteristic histochemical findings of both types were group atrophy, fiber hypertrophy, fiber type predominance and fibrosis. Though there was a slight difference between two types in histological pattern, the basis was so similar. There is controversy about the proper classification of recessive childhood SMA.

The disease appears before the age of 6 months and is characterized by major global hypotonia and abolition of tendon reflexes, with children never being able to sit unaided. Cognitive development is normal and the expressive gaze of these children contrasts with the paralytic attitude. Respiratory involvement predominates in the intercostal muscles, and sometimes brainstem involvement are all serious aspects of the disease. Type I spinal muscular atrophy has been subdivided into 3 groups: - type IA, the clinical signs of which set in between birth and 15 days of life with sudden severe motor impairment, sucking-swallowing disorders attesting to bulbar involvement, respiratory distress. - type IB with onset of symptoms before the age of 3 months, which implies no head control - type IC starting between 3 and 6 months with the possibility of checking head control, often referred to as \"I bis\" by French practitioners. The development and use of innovative therapies in recent years does actually change the natural course of this disease.

Kennedy's disease is nearly exclusively caused by mutations in the androgen receptor encoding gene (AR). The results of studies aimed at identification of the genetic cause of a disease that best approximates SBMA in a pedigree (four patients) without mutations in AR are reported.\nMETHODS: Clinical investigations included thorough neurological and non-neurological examinations and testing. Genetic analysis was performed by exome sequencing using standard protocols. UBA1 mutations were modeled on the crystal structure of UBA1.\nRESULTS: The clinical features of the patients are described in detail. A missense mutation in UBA1 (c.T1499C; p.Ile500Thr) was identified as the probable cause of the non-Kennedy SBMA in the pedigree. Like AR, UBA1 is positioned on chromosome X. UBA1 is a highly conserved gene. It encodes ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 1 (UBA1) which is the major E1 enzyme of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Interestingly, UBA1 mutations can also cause infantile-onset X-linked spinal muscular atrophy (XL-SMA). The mutation identified here and the XL-SMA causative mutations were shown to affect amino acids positioned in the vicinity of UBA1's ATP binding site and to cause structural changes.\nCONCLUSION: UBA1 was identified as a novel SBMA causative gene. The gene affects protein homeostasis which is one of most important components of the pathology of neurodegeneration. The contribution of this same gene to the etiology of XL-SMA is discussed."

Visceral involvement frequent in type 1 and 2 subtypes is rare in SMA3. Hypotonia, hyperlaxity and absent osteo-tendinous reflexes are typical features. By definition, standing or walking without support is achieved but the vast majority of SMA3 patients lose ambulation with time. Lifespan is normal. In some classifications, an additional subtype is included in the mild end of the spectrum, namely spinal muscular atrophy type 4 (SMA4). In this rare subtype, symptoms begin in adulthood; patients remain ambulatory at least until the fifth decade and have a normal respiratory function. Molecular genetic testing is the gold standard tool for diagnosis of SMA. However, diagnosis in a child affected with SMA3 is often challenging because clinical presentation mimics a muscular dystrophy. Electrodiagnostic studies and muscle biopsy are useful tools for demonstrating the presence of denervation but sometimes may not show meaningful differences to help distinguish between SMA and myopathy. Recent specific therapies show promising results before severe neuronal degeneration and motor dysfunction is installed. Therefore, high suspicion should be maintained and genetic analysis performed early in the diagnostic process when facing patients with symmetric and prominent proximal weakness, especially if they present progressive motor impairment. \u00a9 2020 French Society of Pediatrics.

The identification of the underlying gene defects for familial ALS, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress (SMARD) has pointed to distinct pathophysiological mechanisms that are responsible for the various forms of the disease. Accumulating evidence from mouse models suggests that enhanced vulnerability and sensitivity to proapoptotic stimuli is only responsible for some but not all forms of motoneuron disease. Mechanisms that modulate microtubule assembly and the axonal transport machinery are defective in several spontaneous and ENU (ethylnitrososurea) mutagenized mouse models but also in patients with mutations in the p150 subunit of dynactin. Recent evidence suggests that axonal growth defects contribute significantly to the pathophysiology of spinal muscular atrophy. Reduced levels of the survival motoneuron protein that are responsible for SMA lead to disturbed RNA processing in motoneurons. This could also affect axonal transport of mRNAs for beta-actin and other proteins that play an essential role in axon growth and synaptic function. The local translation of specific proteins might be affected, because developing motoneurons contain ribosome-like structures in distal axons and growth cones. Altogether, the evidence from these mouse models and the new genetic data from patients suggest that axon growth and maintenance involves a variety of mechanisms, including microtubule assembly and axonal transport of proteins and ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Thus, defects in axon maintenance could play a leading role in the development of several forms of human motoneuron disease."

Median frequency, onset values were similar in patients and controls. We found a similar decrease in median frequencies of sEMG recordings from the m. biceps brachii, a diminished decrease from the m. brachioradialis and m. flexor digitorum, but a larger decrease from the m. triceps brachii. With respect to capillary recruitment, CW-NIRS recordings in m. biceps brachii revealed dynamics that were both qualitatively and quantitatively similar in patients and controls.\nCONCLUSION: We found no evidence for the contribution of motor unit and capillary recruitment capacity of the upper arm muscles in adolescent and adult patients with SMA types 3 and 4 as primary limiting factors to premature fatigue during execution of a maximal arm-cycling task."

Their identification could provide the key to defining appropriate strategies in clinical dietary management, but data comparing SMAI and SMAII in terms of BC and REE are not yet available. We measured total and regional fat (FM), lean (LBM), mineral (BMC) masses, body water (total, intra- and extra-cellular, TBW, ICW, ECW) and REE in a sample of SMAI and II children, matched for age and sex, and also adjusting for body size to compare these features of the two SMA phenotypes.\nMETHODS: 15 SMAI and 15 SMAII children, (M/F\u00a0=\u00a09/6 vs 9/6, age 3.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9 vs 3.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8 years, p\u00a0=\u00a00.99), confirmed genetically, were measured as follows: Anthropometric measurements [Body Weight (BW), Supine Length (SL), Arm Length (AL), Femur Length (FL), Tibia Length (TL)], Dual x-ray Energy Absorptiometry (DEXA) [total and segmental FM, LBM, FFM, and BMC], Bioelectrical impedance (BIA) [TBW, ICW, ECW] and Indirect Calorimetry (REE, respiratory quotients) were collected by the same trained dietician. BW, SL and Body Mass Index (BMI) Z-scores were calculated according to CDC Growth Charts (2000).\nRESULTS: SMA children had high percentages of FM and a lower percentage of TBW and ECW compared to the respective reference values for sex and age, whereas the BMC percentages did not differ, even splitting the two phenotypes. SMA I children had a lower BW and BMI-Z score compared to children with SMA II, but similar total and segmental FM. On the contrary, total FFM and LBM were significantly lower in SMAI (7290.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01729.1\u00a0g vs 8410.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01508.4\u00a0g; 6971.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01637.1\u00a0g vs 8041.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01427.7\u00a0g, p\u00a0=\u00a00.039, p\u00a0=\u00a00.037, respectively), particularly at the trunk level. Arm BMC also resulted significantly lower in SMAI. The measured REE values were similar (684\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0143\u00a0kcal/day vs 703\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0122\u00a0Kcal/day p\u00a0=\u00a00.707) whereas REE per FFM unit was higher in SMA I children than in SMA II (95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012\u00a0kcal/FFMkg vs 84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0kcal/FFMkg p\u00a0=\u00a00.017).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that BW and BMI Z-score measurements alone can be misleading in assessing nutritional status, particularly in SMAI. The differences between SMAI and II in total and regional BC are related only to FFM, LBM and BMC, and seem to be more linked to the magnitude of neurofunctional impairment rather than to the nutritional status derangement. SMA I and SMA II children can have different energy requirements in relation to their specific BC and hypermetabolism of FFM. Based on these results, our recommendation is to use direct BC and REE measurements in the nutritional care process until SMA-specific predictive equations become available."

Joint torque and muscle activity were measured during maximum voluntary isometric contractions. Three-dimensional kinematics and normalized muscle activity were analyzed when performing tasks.\nRESULTS: Trunk joint torques were significantly decreased, approximately 45%, in patients with spinal muscular atrophy compared with healthy controls. Active range of trunk motion was also significantly decreased in all directions. When performing tasks, the average back muscle activity was 27% and 56% of maximum voluntary isometric contractions for healthy controls and spinal muscular atrophy and for abdominal muscles 10% and 44% of maximum voluntary isometric contractions, respectively. Trunk range of motion did not differ when performing daily tasks.\nCONCLUSIONS: The trunk of patients with spinal muscular atrophy is weaker compared with healthy controls, reflected by reduced trunk torques and decreased active range of motion. In addition, patients with spinal muscular atrophy use high percentages of their trunk muscle capacity to perform tasks. Clinicians should take this into account for intervention development, because using high percentages of the maximum muscle capacity results in fatigue and muscle overloading."

SMA is classified in three clinical types, SMA I, SMA II, and SMA III, based on the severity of the symptoms and the age of onset. About 95% of SMA cases are caused by homozygous deletion of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene (5q13), or its conversion to SMN2. The molecular diagnosis of this disease is usually carried out by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism approach able to evidence the absence of both SMN1 copies. However, this approach is not able to identify heterozygous healthy carriers, which show a very high frequency in general population (1:50). We used the multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) approach for the molecular diagnosis of SMA in 19 affected patient and in 57 individuals at risk to become healthy carriers. This analysis detected the absence of the homozygous SMN1 in all the investigated cases, and allowed to discriminate between SMN1 deletion and conversion to SMN2 on the basis of the size showed by the peaks specific for the different genes mapped within the SMA critical region. Moreover, MLPA analysis evidenced a condition of the absence of the heterozygous SMN1 in 33 out of the 57 relatives of the affected patients, demonstrating the usefulness of this approach in the identification of healthy carriers. Thus, the MLPA technique represents an easy, low cost, and high throughput system in the molecular diagnosis of SMA, both in affected patients and in healthy carriers."

Its estimated incidence is 1:40,000 - 1:77,000 liveborn infants a year. LS is a rare progressive multisystem fatal disorder inherited by autosomal recessive, X-linked and maternal transmission. Clinical onset is predominantly in the first two years of life (average: six months); 50% of patients die within a year, even though there are later- and even adult-onset forms with a more protracted evolution. LS is due to a deficit of various respiratory chain and Krebs cycle enzymes resulting in insufficient production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), in particular cytochrome-c-oxidase (COX), pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and complex I of the respiratory chain, which share an autosomal recessive and X-linked mode of transmission. Cases with maternal inheritance (MILS) are due to a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) point mutation. LS is clinically heterogeneous in relation to the severity of the metabolic dysfunction and is characterized by muscle involvement and especially CNS disorders, particularly psychomotor retardation, ocular symptoms, hypotonia and pyramidal signs. Death is most commonly due to respiratory failure, status epilepticus and sudden coma. The major neuropathological findings, first described by Leigh in 1951, are symmetrical foci of spongy necrosis associated with vessel proliferation and reactive gliosis in basal nuclei, brainstem and thalamus grey matter. The neuronal metabolic alteration can also affect the white matter, resulting in delayed myelination or hypomyelination. The diagnosis rests on clinical signs, elevated CSF lactate, pyruvate and alanine, and biochemical and neuroradiological data. We describe two patients with LS studied with morphological MR associated with diffusion and spectroscopy techniques to assess the diagnostic potential of standard MR imaging and establish whether the association of functional MR methods can improve its diagnostic accuracy. A case of LS with a post-mortem MR study is also described. Three patients with a diagnosis of LS based on clinical, CSF and laboratory data were studied on a GE SIGNA EXCITE 1.5 T unit using an eight-channel phased-array head coil to acquire standard sequences (SE T1; TSE DP T2; FLAIR) and echo-planar diffusion-weighted sequences (DWI; b= 1000 s/mm2) with calculation of ADC maps. The spectroscopic study used single-voxel (TE/TR ms = 144/1500) and multi-voxel techniques (TE/TR ms = 144/1000) at the level of the basal nuclei. Bilateral and symmetrical involvement of basal nuclei grey matter with T2 hyperintensity was a consistent finding in the morphological MR study. In one patient, associated white matter involvement with T2 hyperintensity in periventricular and retrotrigonal areas reflected delayed myelination or hypomyelination. The deep grey matter changes, sometimes associated with white matter lesions, suggested a diagnosis of subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy, in line with the literature. Acute-phase ADC values in affected areas were lower than those of normal grey and white matter and displayed signal hyperintensity on DWI. Reduced ADC values are associated with restricted water diffusivity typical of cytotoxic edema. Spectroscopy showed a high lactate peak, reflecting altered anaerobic glycolysis, and a reduced NAA peak in affected areas, which are however non-specific findings. The most informative study in these patients is standard MR associated with functional techniques, which can confirm the diagnosis obtained with morphological imaging."

The clinical features resemble other muscle diseases, the diagnostic criteria of proximal SMA have recently been defined by the International SMA Consortium. The classification of the clinical picture in different subgroups is still a focus of discussion. At present it seems likely that childhood onset SMA represents a broad spectrum of various ages of onset and different degrees of disability. Apart from different modes of inheritance, there is further evidence of heterogeneity in proximal SMA. The autosomal recessive forms represent the second frequent recessive disorder after cystic fibrosis, whereas autosomal dominant inheritance is an exception in childhood onset SMA. There are no convincing reports of X-linked SMA hitherto. With mapping of acute and chronic forms of childhood SMA to chromosome 5q11.2-13.3 diagnosis by use of DNA markers in affected families has become available. The current possibilities but also problems and limitations of genotype analysis are discussed, with special regard to the application of prenatal diagnosis. We report on the first experiences with prenatal diagnosis in 37 SMA families."

A change in the ChE globular forms in SMA Type 1 and SMA Type 2 was a frequent finding. It is suggested that the absence of the asymmetric A12 AChE form in SMA Type 1 arises because of muscle cell immaturity and undeveloped muscle-nerve interactions.

For the functional assessment we used the Hammersmith and Chop-Intend scales and the data were systematized with the Epi-Info, version 7.0 software. Results: We analyzed 14 patients (42.8 % men). The most prevalent spinal muscular atrophy was type II with 71.4 %. We found phenotypic variability in terms of functionality in some patients with type II spinal muscular atrophy, 37.5 % of whom reached gait. Survival was estimated at 28.6 years. Conclusions: The findings in the group of patients analyzed revealed that the scores of the revised and expanded Hammersmith scales correlated with the severity of SMA."

Estimated incidence is 1 in 6,000 to 1 in 10,000 live births and carrier frequency of 1/40-1/60. This disease is characterized by generalized muscle weakness and atrophy predominating in proximal limb muscles, and phenotype is classified into four grades of severity (SMA I, SMAII, SMAIII, SMA IV) based on age of onset and motor function achieved. This disease is caused by homozygous mutations of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, and the diagnostic test demonstrates in most patients the homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene, generally showing the absence of SMN1 exon 7. The test achieves up to 95% sensitivity and nearly 100% specificity. Differential diagnosis should be considered with other neuromuscular disorders which are not associated with increased CK manifesting as infantile hypotonia or as limb girdle weakness starting later in life. Considering the high carrier frequency, carrier testing is requested by siblings of patients or of parents of SMA children and are aimed at gaining information that may help with reproductive planning. Individuals at risk should be tested first and, in case of testing positive, the partner should be then analyzed. It is recommended that in case of a request on carrier testing on siblings of an affected SMA infant, a detailed neurological examination should be done and consideration given doing the direct test to exclude SMA. Prenatal diagnosis should be offered to couples who have previously had a child affected with SMA (recurrence risk 25%). The role of follow-up coordination has to be managed by an expert in neuromuscular disorders and in SMA who is able to plan a multidisciplinary intervention that includes pulmonary, gastroenterology/nutrition, and orthopedic care. Prognosis depends on the phenotypic severity going from high mortality within the first year for SMA type 1 to no mortality for the chronic and later onset forms."

SMA results from mutations in survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1), leading to deficiency of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Current therapies increase SMN protein and improve patient survival but have variable improvements in motor function, making it necessary to identify complementary strategies to further improve disease outcomes. Here, we perform a genome-wide RNAi screen using a luciferase-based activity reporter and identify genes involved in regulating SMN gene expression, RNA processing, and protein stability. We show that reduced expression of Transcription Export complex components increases SMN levels through the regulation of nuclear/cytoplasmic RNA transport. We also show that the E3 ligase, Neurl2, works cooperatively with Mib1 to ubiquitinate and promote SMN degradation. Together, our screen uncovers pathways through which SMN expression is regulated, potentially revealing additional strategies to treat SMA."

Clinical heterogeneity is pervasive: three infantile (type I-III) and one adult-onset (type IV) forms are recognized. Type I SMA is the most common genetic cause of death in infancy and accounts for about 50% of all patients with SMA. Most forms of SMA are caused by mutations of the survival motor neuron (SMN1) gene. A second gene that is 99% identical to SMN1 (SMN2) is located in the same region. The only functionally relevant difference between the two genes identified to date is a C\u2009\u2192\u2009T transition in exon 7 of SMN2, which determines an alternative spliced isoform that predominantly excludes exon 7. Thus, SMN2 genes do not produce sufficient full length SMN protein to prevent the onset of the disease. Since the identification of the causative mutation, biomedical research of SMA has progressed by leaps and bounds: from clues on the function of SMN protein, to the development of different models of the disease, to the identification of potential treatments, some of which are currently in human trials. The aim of this review is to elucidate the current state of knowledge, emphasizing how close we are to the solution of the puzzle that is SMA, and, more importantly, to highlight the missing pieces of this puzzle. Filling in these gaps in our knowledge will likely accelerate the development and delivery of efficient treatments for SMA patients and be a prerequisite towards achieving our final goal, the cure of SMA."

SMA is caused by reduced survival motor neuron (SMN) protein levels due to biallelic deletions or mutations in the SMN1 gene. When SMN levels fall under a certain threshold, a plethora of cellular pathways are disturbed, including RNA processing, protein synthesis, metabolic defects, and mitochondrial function. Dysfunctional mitochondria can harm cells by decreased ATP production and increased oxidative stress due to elevated cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since neurons mainly produce energy via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, restoring metabolic/oxidative homeostasis might rescue SMA pathology. Here, we report, based on proteome analysis, that SMA motor neurons show disturbed energy homeostasis due to dysfunction of mitochondrial complex I. This results in a lower basal ATP concentration and higher ROS production that causes an increase of protein carbonylation and impaired protein synthesis in SMA motor neurons. Counteracting these cellular impairments with pyruvate reduces elevated ROS levels, increases ATP and SMN protein levels in SMA motor neurons. Furthermore, we found that pyruvate-mediated SMN protein synthesis is mTOR-dependent. Most importantly, we showed that ROS regulates protein synthesis at the translational initiation step, which is impaired in SMA. As many neuropathies share pathological phenotypes such as dysfunctional mitochondria, excessive ROS, and impaired protein synthesis, our findings suggest new molecular interactions among these pathways. Additionally, counteracting these impairments by reducing ROS and increasing ATP might be beneficial for motor neuron survival in SMA patients."

SMA is caused by homozygous mutation or loss of the telomeric copy of the survival of motor neuron gene (SMN). The SMN gene is localized as an inverted repeat on chromosome 5q13. Both gene copies (SMN1 and SMN2) are expressed, but they differ in the expression of full-length protein. SMN2 gene preferentially gives rise to a truncated and less stable version of the SMN protein and thus can not compensate for SMN1 loss or mutations unless it is not present in multiple copies. The SMN protein is part of multiprotein complexes in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of all cell types. These complexes are involved in assembly of spliceosomal snRNPs. SMN interacts with RNA polymerase II and other binding proteins, indicating that the SMN protein is involved in messenger and ribosomal RNA transcription and processing.

To this end, we report the first cloning and identification of the swine SMN1 gene and show that there is significant sequence homology between swine and human SMN throughout the coding region. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction results demonstrated slight changes in SMN RNA expression during development and in different tissues. In contrast, protein expression profiles were dramatically different based upon different tissues and developmental stages, consistent with human SMN expression. Porcine SMN localization is consistent with human SMN, localizing diffusely within the cytoplasm and in punctate nuclear structures characteristic of nuclear gems. Importantly, transient transfection of porcine SMN1 in 3813 SMA type 1 fibroblasts demonstrate that porcine SMN1 can rescue the deficiency of SMN protein and gem formation in these cells. These studies provide the first characterization of the porcine SMN1 gene and SMN protein and suggest that a transgenic swine SMA model is feasible."

We report two newborns with a clinical phenotype consistent with that of spinal muscular atrophy type I and nerve conduction studies and electromyography suggesting more extensive sensory involvement than classically described with spinal muscular atrophy. Molecular testing confirmed spinal muscular atrophy in patient 1 but not in patient 2. Thus, in the setting of a suspected congenital axonal neuropathy, molecular testing might be necessary to distinguish spinal muscular atrophy type I from infantile polyneuropathy."

Although there is few promising treatment for SMA, but the field of translational research is active in it, and stem cell-based therapy clinical trials or case studies are ongoing. Combination of different therapeutic approaches for noncurative treatments may increase their effectiveness and compliance of patients. We present a phase 1 clinical trial in patients with SMA1 who received side population adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (SPADMSCs).\nMETHODS: The intervention group received three intrathecal administrations of escalating doses of SPADMSCs and followed until 24 months or the survival time. The safety analysis was assessed by controlling the side effects and efficacy evaluations performed by the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE), Ballard score, and electrodiagnostic (EDX) evaluation. These evaluations were performed before intervention and at the end of the follow-up.\nRESULTS: The treatment was safe and well tolerated, without any adverse event related to the stem cell administration. One of the patients in the intervention group was alive after 24 months of study follow-up. He is a non-sitter 62-month-old boy with appropriate weight gain and need for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) for about 8 h per day. Clinical scores, need for supportive ventilation, and number of hospitalizations were not meaningful parameters in the response of patients in the intervention and control groups. All five patients in the intervention group showed significant improvement in the motor amplitude response of the tibial nerve (0.56mV; p: 0.029).\nCONCLUSION: This study showed that SPADMSCs therapy is tolerable and safe with promising efficacy in SMA I. Probably same as other treatment strategies, early intervention will increase its efficacy and prepare time for more injections. We suggest EDX evaluation for the follow-up of treatment efficacy."

Patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 utilizing supportive care, which focuses on symptom management, never sit unassisted, and 75% die or require permanent ventilation by age 13.6\u00a0months. Onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma, formerly AVXS-101) is a gene replacement therapy comprising an adeno-associated viral vector containing the human SMN gene under control of the chicken beta-actin promoter. This therapy addresses the genetic root cause of the disease by increasing functional SMN protein in motor neurons and preventing neuronal cell death, resulting in improved neuronal and muscular function as previously demonstrated in transgenic animal models. In an open-label, one-arm, dose-escalation phase 1 trial, systemic administration of onasemnogene abeparvovec via a one-time infusion over one\u00a0hour demonstrated improved motor function and survival in all infants symptomatic for spinal muscular atrophy type 1. Of the 12 patients who received the proposed therapeutic dose, 11 achieved independent sitting, two achieved independent standing, and two are able to walk. Most of these 12 patients remained free of respiratory supportive care. The only treatment-related adverse event observed was transient asymptomatic transaminasemia that resolved with a short course of prednisolone treatment. This review discusses the biological rationale underlying gene replacement therapy for spinal muscular atrophy, describes the onasemnogene abeparvovec clinical trial experience, and provides expert recommendations as a reference for the real-world use of onasemnogene abeparvovec in clinical practice. As of May 24, 2019, the Food and Drug Administration approved onasemnogene abeparvovec, the first gene therapy approved to treat children younger than two years with spinal muscular atrophy."

Cases without SMN1 mutations are subclassified according to phenotype. Spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity-predominant, is characterized by lower limb muscle weakness and wasting, associated with reduced numbers of lumbar motor neurons and is caused by mutations in DYNC1H1, which encodes a microtubule motor protein in the dynein-dynactin complex and one of its cargo adaptors, BICD2. We have now identified 32 patients with BICD2 mutations from nine different families, providing detailed insights into the clinical phenotype and natural history of BICD2 disease. BICD2 spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity predominant most commonly presents with delayed motor milestones and ankle contractures. Additional features at presentation include arthrogryposis and congenital dislocation of the hips. In all affected individuals, weakness and wasting is lower-limb predominant, and typically involves both proximal and distal muscle groups. There is no evidence of sensory nerve involvement. Upper motor neuron signs are a prominent feature in a subset of individuals, including one family with exclusively adult-onset upper motor neuron features, consistent with a diagnosis of hereditary spastic paraplegia. In all cohort members, lower motor neuron features were static or only slowly progressive, and the majority remained ambulant throughout life. Muscle MRI in six individuals showed a common pattern of muscle involvement with fat deposition in most thigh muscles, but sparing of the adductors and semitendinosus. Muscle pathology findings were highly variable and included pseudomyopathic features, neuropathic features, and minimal change. The six causative mutations, including one not previously reported, result in amino acid changes within all three coiled-coil domains of the BICD2 protein, and include a possible 'hot spot' mutation, p.Ser107Leu present in four families. We used the recently solved crystal structure of a highly conserved region of the Drosophila orthologue of BICD2 to further-explore how the p.Glu774Gly substitution inhibits the binding of BICD2 to Rab6. Overall, the features of BICD2 spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity predominant are consistent with a pathological process that preferentially affects lumbar lower motor neurons, with or without additional upper motor neuron involvement. Defining the phenotypic features in this, the largest BICD2 disease cohort reported to date, will facilitate focused genetic testing and filtering of next generation sequencing-derived variants in cases with similar features."

SMA disease severity ranges from extremely severe to a relatively mild adult onset form of proximal muscle atrophy. Severe SMA patients typically die mostly within months or a few years as a consequence of respiratory insufficiency and bulbar paralysis. SMA is widely known as a motor neuron disease; however, there are numerous clinical reports indicating the involvement of additional peripheral organs contributing to the complete picture of the disease in severe cases.

Most spinal muscular atrophy cases clinically manifest during infancy or childhood, although it may first manifest in adulthood. Although spinal muscular atrophy has come to the era of newborn screening and promising treatments, genetically confirmed spinal muscular atrophy patients are still rare in third world countries, including Indonesia.\nCASE PRESENTATIONS: We presented three Indonesian patients with spinal muscular atrophy genetically confirmed during adulthood. The first case was a 40-year-old male who presented with weakness in his lower limbs that started when he was 9\u00a0years old. At the age of 16\u00a0years, he could no longer walk and started using a wheelchair. He first came to our clinic at the age of 38\u00a0years, and was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy 2\u00a0years later. The second patient was a 58-year-old male who presented with lower limb weakness since he was 12\u00a0years old. Owing to the geographical distance and financial problems, he was referred to our clinic at the age of 56\u00a0years, when he already used a walker to walk. Lastly, the third patient was a 28-year-old woman, who was in the first semester of her second pregnancy, and who presented with slowly progressing lower limb weakness. Her limb weakness began at the age of 8\u00a0years, and slowly progressed until she became dependent on her wheelchair 8\u00a0years later until now. She had successfully given birth to a healthy daughter 3\u00a0years before her first visit to our clinic. All three patients were diagnosed with neuromuscular disorder diseases, with the differential diagnoses of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, and Becker muscular dystrophy. These patients were finally confirmed to have spinal muscular atrophy due to SMN1 deletion by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism.\nCONCLUSIONS: Many genetic diseases are often neglected in developing countries owing to the difficulty in diagnosis and unavailable treatment. Our case series focused on the disease courses, diagnosis difficulties, and clinical presentations of three patients that finally lead to diagnoses of spinal muscular atrophy."

Nusinersen, an antisense oligonucleotide, promotes production of full-length protein from the pseudogene SMN2. Nusinersen treatment prolongs survival of patients with type 1 SMA and allows motor milestone acquisition. Patients with type 2 SMA also show progress on different motor scales after nusinersen treatment. Nusinersen was recently approved by the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration; it is now reimbursed in several European countries and in the USA. In Australia, the transition from expanded access programme to commercial availability is coming soon. In New Zealand, an expanded access programme is opened, and in Canada price negotiation for the treatment is in progress. In this review we exemplify the clinical benefit of nusinersen in subgroups of patients with SMA. Nusinersen represents the first efficacious marked approved drug in type 1 and type 2 SMA. Different knowledge gaps, such as results in older patients, in patients with permanent ventilation, in patients with neonatal forms, or in patients after spinal fusion, still need to be addressed.

Here we provide the clinical, pathological and genetic features of 576 dystrophinopathy patients. DMD gene analysis was performed using the MLPA technique and whole gene sequencing in blood DNA and muscle cDNA. The impact of the DNA variants on mRNA splicing and protein functionality was evaluated by in silico analysis using computational algorithms. DMD mutations were detected in 576 unrelated dystrophinopathy families by combining the analysis of exonic copies and the analysis of small mutations. We found that 471 of these mutations were large intragenic rearrangements. Of these, 406 (70.5%) were exonic deletions, 64 (11.1%) were exonic duplications, and one was a deletion/duplication complex rearrangement (0.2%). Small mutations were identified in 105 cases (18.2%), most being nonsense/frameshift types (75.2%). Mutations in splice sites, however, were relatively frequent (20%). In total, 276 mutations were identified, 85 of which have not been previously described. The diagnostic algorithm used proved to be accurate for the molecular diagnosis of dystrophinopathies.

A national registration network is essential not only to provide more information about the prevalence and natural history of the disease, but also to collect genetic data for analyzing the mutational spectrum. This information is extremely beneficial for basic scientific research, genetic diagnosis, trial planning, clinical care, and gene therapy.\nMETHODS: We collected data from 1400 patients (1042 patients with confirmed unrelated Duchenne muscular dystrophy [DMD] or Becker muscular dystrophy [BMD]) registered in the Chinese Genetic Disease Registry from March 2012 to August 2017 and analyzed the genetic mutational characteristics of these patients.\nRESULTS: Large deletions were the most frequent type of mutation (72.2%), followed by nonsense mutations (11.9%), exon duplications (8.8%), small deletions (3.0%), splice-site mutations (2.1%), small insertions (1.3%), missense mutations (0.6%), and a combination mutation of a deletion and a duplication (0.1%). Exon 45-50 deletion was the most frequent deletion type, while exon 2 duplication was the most common duplication type. Two deletion hotspots were calculated-one located toward the central part (exon 45-52) of the gene and the other toward the 5'end (exon 8-26). We found no significant difference between hereditary and de novo mutations on deletion hotspots. Nonsense mutations accounted for 62.9% of all small mutations (197 patients).\nCONCLUSION: We built a comprehensive national dystrophinopathy mutation database in China, which is essential for basic and clinical research in this field. The mutational spectrum and characteristics of this DMD/BMD group were largely consistent with those in previous international DMD/BMD studies, with some differences. Based on our results, about 12% of DMD/BMD patients with nonsense mutations may benefit from stop codon read-through therapy.

The mean age of diagnosis was 3.9\u00b12.0 years. 78% were treated with glucocorticoids from age 5.8\u00b11.5 years. 23 boys (35%) had lost ambulation at an age of 10.7\u00b12.0 years. 17% were treated for left ventricular dysfunction from age 12.1\u00b13.0 years and 12% had received night-time non-invasive positive pressure ventilation from age 13.0\u00b12.5 years.\nCONCLUSIONS: The distribution of mutation types and sites was similar to previous studies but with more duplications and fewer point mutations. Any genotype-phenotype correlations were not uncovered. The boys were diagnosed early but there is still diagnostic delay among boys presenting with late motor development. Glucocorticoid treatment was widespread, especially among the younger boys. The clinical results of this comprehensive nationwide study highlight the large variability of disease progression in DMD."

To investigate mutation types and distribution characteristics of dystrophin gene in Chinese DMD patients, we used Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to analyze the dystrophin gene in 720 DMD patients, their mothers, and 20 normal adult males. Results showed that detection rate was 64.9% (467/720) in all the patients, gene deletion rate was 54.3% (391/720), and gene duplication rate was 10.6% (76/720). The rate of deletion mutant occurred in Exon 45-54 was 71.9% (281/391) in all gene deletion patients; meanwhile, the rate of gene duplication occurred in Exon 1-40 was 82.9% (63/76) in all gene duplication ones. In all the patients with gene deletion and duplication, the rate of DMD and IMD was 90.6% (423/467), and BMD, 9.4% (44/467). This indicates that the main reason of duchenne muscular dystrophy is dystrophin gene deletion mutation, which would occur in any gene unevenly with hot spots of mutation. The location and fragment length of gene deletion and duplication cannot decide the severity of clinical symptoms directly."

Typically, DMD patients pass away from heart failure or respiratory failure. Currently, there is no cure, though exon-skipping therapy including eteplirsen (brand name Exondys 51), a synthetic antisense oligonucleotide designed to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene, is considered especially promising. Applicable to approximately 14% of DMD patients, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) antisense oligonucleotide eteplirsen received accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016. Throughout clinical trials, eteplirsen has been well tolerated by patients with no serious drug-related adverse events. The most common events observed are balance disorder, vomiting, and skin rash. Despite its safety and promise of functional benefits, eteplirsen remains controversial due to its low production of dystrophin. In addition, unmodified PMOs have limited efficacy in the heart. To address these concerns of efficacy, eteplirsen has been conjugated to a proprietary cell-penetrating peptide; the conjugate is called SRP-5051. Compared to eteplirsen, SRP-5051 aims to better prompt exon-skipping and dystrophin production but may have greater toxicity concerns. This paper reviews and discusses the available information on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability data of eteplirsen and SRP-5051 from preclinical and clinical trials. Issues faced by eteplirsen and SRP-5051, including efficacy and safety, are identified. Lastly, the current state of eteplirsen and exon-skipping therapy in general as a strategy for the treatment of DMD are discussed."

A relationship between exon skipping and dystrophin production in exon 51-amenable patients treated with eteplirsen (EXONDYS 51\u00ae) is established. Once-weekly eteplirsen significantly increased dystrophin, with slower decline in ambulatory function compared to baseline. Long-term treatment with eteplirsen leads to accumulation of dystrophin over time and observed functional benefits in patients with DMD.\nOBJECTIVE: Compare long-term ambulatory function in eteplirsen-treated patients versus controls.\nMETHODS: Study 201/202 included 12 eteplirsen-treated patients assessed twice/year for ambulatory function over 4 years. Ambulatory evaluations (6-minute walk test [6MWT], loss of ambulation, and North Star Ambulatory Assessment [NSAA]) were compared with matched controls from Italian Telethon and Leuven registries.\nRESULTS: At Years 3 and 4, eteplirsen-treated patients demonstrated markedly greater mean 6MWT than controls (difference in change from baseline of 132 m [95%CI (29, 235), p\u200a=\u200a0.015] at Year 3 and 159\u200am [95%CI (66, 253), p\u200a=\u200a0.002] at Year 4). At Year 4, a significantly greater proportion of eteplirsen-treated patients were still ambulant versus controls (10/12 vs 3/11; p\u200a=\u200a0.020). At Year 3, eteplirsen-treated patients demonstrated milder NSAA decline versus controls (difference in change from baseline of 2.6, 95%CI [-6, 11]), however, the difference was not statistically significant; Year 4 control NSAA data were not available.\nCONCLUSION: In this retrospective matched control study, eteplirsen treatment resulted in attenuation of ambulatory decline over a 4-year observation period, supporting long-term benefit in patients with DMD."

Median age at LOA was 15.16 years. Eteplirsen-treated patients experienced a statistically significant longer median time to LOA by 2.09 years (5.09 vs. 3.00 years, p\u200a<\u200a0.01) and significantly attenuated rates of pulmonary decline vs. natural history patients (FVC%p change: -3.3 vs. -6.0 percentage points annually, p\u200a<\u200a0.0001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Study 405 highlights the functional benefits of eteplirsen on ambulatory and pulmonary function outcomes up to 7 years of follow-up in comparison to external controls."

There is no longer any doubt that antisense oligomers can redirect dystrophin gene processing and by-pass protein truncating mutations after direct injection into muscle. Proof-of-concept has been demonstrated in human dystrophic muscle, with trials in Leiden and London showing that two different oligomer chemistries can restore the reading-frame in selected DMD patients by excising dystrophin exon 51. Systemic delivery of both oligomer types into DMD patients has commenced with promising results but it remains to be established if this therapy will have measurable clinical benefits. Targeted removal of exon 51 will only be directly applicable to about one in ten DMD individuals, and the immediate challenges include development of appropriate and effective delivery regimens, and extending splice-switching therapies to other dystrophin gene lesions. The success of induced exon skipping has spawned a number of \"fusion therapies\", including vector-mediated dystrophin exon skipping and ex vivo viral delivery of splice-switching antisense molecules into myogenic stem cells, followed by implantation, which may address long term oligomer delivery issues.

DMD leads to progressive muscle weakness, degeneration, and wasting; finally, follows with the premature demise in affected individuals due to respiratory and/or cardiac failure typically by age of 30. For decades, scientists tried massively to find an effective therapy method, but there is no absolute cure currently for patients with DMD, nevertheless, recent advanced progressions on the treatment of DMD will be hopeful in the future. Several promising gene therapies are currently under investigation. These include gene replacement, exon skipping, suppression of stop codons. More recently, a promising gene editing tool referred to as CRISPR/Cas9 offers exciting perspectives for restoring dystrophin expression in patients with DMD. This review intents to briefly describe these methods and comment on their advances. Since DMD is a genetic disorder, it should be treated by replacing the deficient DMD copy with a functional one. However, there are different types of mutations in this gene, so such therapeutic approaches are highly mutation specific and thus are personalized. Therefore, DMD has arisen as a model of genetic disorder for understanding and overcoming of the challenges of developing personalized genetic medicines, consequently, the lessons learned from these approaches will be applicable to many other disorders.\nCONCLUSIONS: This review provides an update on the recent gene therapies for DMD that aim to compensate for dystrophin deficiency and the related clinical trials."

We have explored a gene correction therapy aimed at restoration of the reading frame in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. Through the binding of antisense oligoribonucleotides to exon-internal sequences in the pre-mRNA, the splicing can be manipulated in such a manner that the targeted exon is skipped and a slightly shorter, but in-frame, transcript is generated. We recently showed that antisense oligoribonucleotide-mediated skipping of exon 46 efficiently induced dystrophin synthesis in cultured muscle cells from Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients carrying an exon 45 deletion. In this study we have identified antisense oligoribonucleotides with which the skipping of 11 other Duchenne muscular dystrophy exons could be induced in cultured human muscle cells. The targeted skipping of only one particular exon may restore the reading frame in a series of patients with different mutations. Accordingly, these antisense oligoribonucleotides would allow correction of over 50% of deletions and 22% of duplications reported in the Leiden DMD-mutation Database."

Years of research have come to fruition during the past 18 months with publications on clinical trials for several gene therapy approaches for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This review covers the present status of these approaches.\nRECENT FINDINGS: The exon skipping approach is most advanced in the process of clinical application. Encouraging results have been obtained in two systemic clinical trials and further optimization has increased delivery to the heart in animal models. Limitations of the approach are the mutation-specificity and the anticipated requirement for lifelong treatment. Gene therapy by means of gene transfer holds the promise of more long-lasting effects. Results of a first, early-stage gene therapy trial, using viral vectors to deliver a minidystrophin gene, were reported. Animal studies suggest that it may be possible to overcome the main challenges currently facing gene therapy (immunogenicity of the vector and systemic body-wide delivery).\nSUMMARY: Significant steps have been made in the development of gene therapy approaches for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. These approaches aim to slow down disease progression, requiring robust outcome measures to assess efficacy."

It is caused by the mutation of the DMD gene, which encodes dystrophin, a sub-sarcolemmal protein essential for structural muscle stability. The genetic defects in the DMD gene are divided into: deletions (65%) duplications (5.10%) and point mutations (10-15%). At present there is no curative treatment, the only drug that has been shown to modify the natural history of the disease (independently of the genetic mutation) are corticosteroids, currently indicated in early stages of the disease. In relation to clinical trials, in the last ten years, has experienced great advances in the field of therapeutic options, divided into two major therapeutic targets: 1) the area of gene therapies and 2) trying to reverse or block the pathophysiological processes of the disease, such as inflammation, fibrosis, muscle regeneration, etc. It is likely that an effective treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy requires combinations of therapies that address both the primary defect and its secondary pathophysiological consequences."

DMD is the most common and severe form of muscular dystrophy and current treatments are far from adequate. However, genetic and cell-based therapies, in particular exon skipping induced by antisense strategies, and corrective gene therapy via functionally engineered dystrophin genes hold great promise, with several clinical trials ongoing. Proof-of-concept of exon skipping has been obtained in animal models, and most recently in clinical trials; this approach represents a promising therapy for a subset of patients. In addition, gene-delivery-based strategies exist both for antisense-induced reading frame restoration, and for highly efficient delivery of functional dystrophin mini- and micro-genes to muscle fibres in vivo and muscle stem cells ex-vivo. In particular, AAV-based vectors show efficient systemic gene delivery to skeletal muscle directly in vivo, and lentivirus-based vectors show promise of combining ex vivo gene modification strategies with cell-mediated therapies."

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common childhood genetic disease, affecting one in 3500 newborn boys, causing progressive muscle weakness, heart and respiratory failure and premature death. No cure exists for this disease and a number of promising new molecular therapies are being intensively studied. Duchenne muscular dystrophy arises due to mutations that disrupt the open-reading-frame in the DMD gene leading to the absence of the essential muscle protein dystrophin. Of all novel molecular interventions currently being investigated for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, perhaps the most promising method aiming to restore dystrophin expression to diseased cells is known as 'exon skipping' or splice-modulation, whereby antisense oligonucleotides eliminate the deleterious effects of DMD mutations by modulating dystrophin pre-messenger RNA splicing, such that functional dystrophin protein is produced. Recently this method was shown to be promising and safe in clinical trials both in The Netherlands and the UK. These trials studied direct antisense oligonucleotide injections into single peripheral lower limb muscles, whereas a viable therapy will need antisense oligonucleotides to be delivered systemically to all muscles, most critically to the heart, and ultimately to all other affected tissues including brain. There has also been considerable progress in understanding how such splice-correction methods could be applied to the treatment of related neuromuscular diseases, including spinal muscular atrophy and myotonic dystrophy, where defects of splicing or alternative splicing are closely related to the disease mechanism."

Genetic confirmation has become standard in recent years. Improvements in the standard of care for DMD have led to improved survival. Novel treatments for DMD have focused on reducing the dystrophic mechanism of the muscle disease, modulating utrophin protein expression, and restoring dystrophin protein expression. Among the strategies to reduce the dystrophic mechanisms are 1) inhibiting inflammation, 2) promoting muscle growth and regeneration, 3) reducing fibrosis, and 4) facilitating mitochondrial function. The agents under investigation include a novel steroid, myostatin inhibitors, idebenone, an anti-CTGF antibody, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, and cardiosphere-derived cells. For utrophin modulation, AAV-mediated gene therapy with GALGT2 is currently being investigated to upregulate utrophin expression. Finally, the strategies for dystrophin protein restoration include 1) nonsense readthrough, 2) synthetic antisense oligonucleotides for exon skipping, and 3) AAV-mediated micro/minidystrophin gene delivery.

What advances does it highlight? Over the last two decades, considerable progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying Duchenne muscular dystrophy, leading to the development of genetic therapies. These include manipulation of the expression of the gene or related genes, the splicing of the gene and its translation, and replacement of the gene using viral approaches. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a lethal X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. In the absence of the dystrophin protein, the link between the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix is destroyed, and this severely compromises the strength, flexibility and stability of muscle fibres. The devastating consequence is progressive muscle wasting and premature death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. There is currently no cure, and despite exhaustive palliative care, patients are restricted to a wheelchair by the age of 12 years and usually succumb to cardiac or respiratory complications in their late 20s. This review provides an update on the current genetically based therapies and clinical trials that target or compensate for the primary defect of this disease. These include dystrophin gene-replacement strategies, genetic modification techniques to restore dystrophin expression, and modulation of the dystrophin homologue, utrophin, as a surrogate to re-establish muscle function."

The manifestations of this disease include progressive muscle weakness, gait dysfunction, and motor impairment, leading to a loss of ambulation by the age of 13\u2009years. Molecular diagnosis is the standard diagnostic tool for DMD. This study aimed to investigate disease progression and genetic patterns in Iranian ambulant boys and to find the correlation between genotypes and motor function phenotypes.\nMETHODS: This study was performed on 152 DMD patients. Clinical history, including the disease phenotype, steroid therapy, and the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) score, was taken for all the patients. Molecular diagnoses were confirmed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and next-generation sequencing tests.\nRESULTS: A total of 152 Iranian DMD patients were examined in this study. The mean age at the time of disease onset was 4.04\u2009\u00b1\u20092.00\u2009years, and the mean age at diagnosis was 5.05\u2009\u00b1\u20092.08\u2009years. The mean age of ambulation loss was 10.9\u2009years. Contracture was reported in 38.9% of cases. In terms of age, the mean total NSAA score showed a peak at 4 years of age, with a mean NSAA score of 24. Annual changes in the NSAA score were determined for all cases, based on the mutation type and exon site. Deletion mutation was found in 79.1% of cases, duplication in 6.8%, nonsense in 12.8%, and splice site in 1.4%. The most common single exon deletion was exon 44 (5.3%), and the most common multiexon deletions were attributed to exons 45-50 and exons 45-52 (4.6%). The results did not indicate any correlation between the mutation type and age at the time of disease onset, loss of ambulation age, and wheelchair dependence; however, a significant association was found between contracture and mutation type. The results showed a significant difference in the NSAA score between the deletion and nonsense groups at the age of 3 years (P\u2009=\u20090.04). No significant correlation was found between the phenotype and exon site. Overall, 91.1% of the study population had a history of corticosteroid use, and 54.1% showed compliance with rehabilitation therapy.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the phenotypes and mutational features of Iranian DMD boys and provided information regarding the natural motor history of the disease, disease progression, diagnosis, and status of DMD management in Iran. The present findings can promote the development of clinical trials and future advanced molecular therapies in Iran."

More specifically, we wished to establish the spectrum of findings for each measure and their correlation. This is a prospective multicentric study involving 10 centers. The cohort included 112 ambulant DMD boys of age ranging between 4.10 and 17 years (mean 8.18\u00b12.3 DS). Ninety-one of the 112 were on steroids: 37/91 on intermittent and 54/91 on daily regimen. The scores on the North Star assessment ranged from 6/34 to 34/34. The distance on the 6-minute walk test ranged from 127 to 560.6 m. The time to walk 10 m was between 3 and 15 s. The time to rise from the floor ranged from 1 to 27.5 s. Some patients were unable to rise from the floor. As expected the results changed with age and were overall better in children treated with daily steroids. The North Star assessment had a moderate to good correlation with 6-minute walk test and with timed rising from floor but less with 10 m timed walk/run test. The 6-minute walk test in contrast had better correlation with 10 m timed walk/run test than with timed rising from floor. These findings suggest that a combination of these outcome measures can be effectively used in ambulant DMD boys and will provide information on different aspects of motor function, that may not be captured using a single measure."

To gain a better understanding of the longitudinal utility of the NSAA, we evaluated NSAA data from a phase II trial of 120 patients with DMD treated with domagrozumab or placebo.\nMETHODS: The NSAA exploratory analyses included assessment of individual skills gained/lost, total skills gained/lost, cumulative loss of function, and the impact of transient loss of function due to a temporary disability on NSAA total score (temporary zero score).\nRESULTS: There was no significant difference in the total number of NSAA skills gained (mean 1.41 and 1.04, respectively; p = 0.3314) or lost (3.90 vs. 5.0; p = 0.0998) between domagrozumab- vs. placebo-treated patients at week 49. However, domagrozumab-treated patients were less likely to lose the ability to perform a NSAA item (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65-0.98, p = 0.029) over 48-weeks vs. placebo-treated patients. When temporary zero scores were changed to \"not obtainable\" (8 values from 7 patients), domagrozumab-treated patients scored higher on the NSAA total score versus placebo-treated patients (difference at week 49: 2.0, 95% CI: 0.1-3.9, p = 0.0359).\nCONCLUSIONS: These exploratory analyses reveal additional approaches to interpreting the NSAA data beyond just change in NSAA total score. These observations also highlight the importance of reporting items as \"not obtainable\" for a patient with a temporary/transient physical disability that impacts their ability to perform the NSAA test.\nCLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02310763."

The quality of evidence of the measurement properties was moderate (23.8%) or low (22.6%) according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE).\nINTERPRETATION: There is a lack of high-quality instruments whose psychometric properties are adequately measured. The highest quality instrument is the Muscular Dystrophy Functional Rating Scale. The Motor Function Measure (general instrument), Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Upper-limb Patient-reported Outcome Measure, North Star Ambulatory Assessment, and Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 Activity and Participation Scale for Clinical Use (specific) are also recommended.\nWHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: There are 28 available instruments for activity and participation of people with muscular dystrophy. The evidence quality is moderate or low because of imprecision and indirectness. The Muscular Dystrophy Functional Rating Scale is the highest quality instrument. The Motor Function Measure is the second most recommended instrument. The Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Upper-limb Patient-reported Outcome Measure, North Star Ambulatory Assessment, and Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 Activity and Participation Scale for Clinical Use are also recommended."

We hypothesised that boys with DMD could be clustered into groups sharing similar trajectories of ambulatory function over time, as measured by the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) total score. We also explored associations with other variables such as age, functional abilities, and genotype. Using the NorthStar Clinical Network database, 395 patients with >1 NSAA assessment were identified. We utilised latent class trajectory analysis of longitudinal NSAA scores, which produced evidence for at least four clusters of boys sharing similar trajectories versus age in decreasing order of clinical severity: 25% of the boys were in cluster 1 (NSAA falling to \u2264 5 at age ~10y), 35% were in cluster 2 (NSAA \u2264 5 ~12y), 21% in were cluster 3 (NSAA\u2264 5 ~14y), and 19% in cluster 4 (NSAA > 5 up to 15y). Mean ages at diagnosis of DMD were similar across clusters (4.2, 3.9, 4.3, and 4.8y, respectively). However, at the first NSAA assessment, a significant (p<0.05) association was observed between earlier declining clusters and younger age, worse NSAA, slower rise from supine, slower 10 metre walk/run times, and younger age of steroid initiation. In order to assess the probability of observing complete loss of function for individual NSAA items, we examined the proportion of patients who shifted from a score of 1 or 2 at baseline to a score of 0. We also assessed the probability of gain of function using the inverse assessment and stratified the probability of deterioration, improvement-or static behavior-by age ranges and using baseline functional status. Using this tool, our study provides a comprehensive assessment of the NSAA in a large population of patients with DMD and, for the first time, describes discrete clusters of disease progression; this will be invaluable for future DMD clinical trial design and interpretation of findings."

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and subsequent Government 'lockdown' resulted in no face-to-face clinic visits hence the motor abilities were not monitored. The aim was to investigate whether the NSAA was feasible and reliable by video assessment.\nMETHOD: Ten ambulant DMD boys were selected from the electronic hospital records. Two physiotherapists scored the boys' NSAA independently and the intraclass correlation coefficient was used to assess agreement. The video scores were compared to two previous NSAA in-clinic scores.\nRESULTS: Mean scores (SD) for clinic visit one were 22.6 (4.19) and clinic visit two 21.8 (5.3). The two physiotherapists video mean scores were 20.6 (5.66) for physiotherapist 1 and 20.6 (6.53) for physiotherapist 2. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.98 (95% CI 0.93-1.00) for the total NSAA and 1.00 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.00) for the rise time. The mean decline in score from clinic visit one (-12 months) to video assessment was 2.0 (2.8SD).\nCONCLUSION: The results from the study suggest that video NSAA is partially feasible and reliable."

Therefore, we need robust evidence to support such tools. The North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) is a promising, clinician-rated scale with potential uses spanning clinical practice and clinical trials. In this study, we used Rasch analysis to test its suitability in these roles as a measurement instrument.\nMETHOD: NSAA data from 191 ambulant boys (mean age at assessment 7 y 8 mo, SD 2 y 4 mo; range 3 y 6 mo-15 y 5 mo) with a confirmed diagnosis of DMD were examined for psychometric properties including clinical meaning, targeting, response categories, model fit, reliability, dependency, stability, and raw to interval-level measurement. All analyses were performed using the Rasch Unidimensional Measurement Model.\nRESULTS: Overall, Rasch analysis supported the NSAA as being a reliable (high Person Separation Index of 0.91) and valid (good targeting, little misfit, no reversed thresholds) measure of ambulatory function in DMD. One item displayed misfit (lifts head, fit residual 6.9) and there was evidence for some local dependency (stand on right/left leg, climb and descend box step right/left leg, and hop on right/left leg, residual correlations >0.40), which we provide potential solutions for in future use of the NSAA. Importantly, our findings supported good clinical validity in that the hierarchy of items within the scale produced by the analyses was supported by clinical opinion, thus increasing the clinical interpretability of scale scores.\nINTERPRETATION: In general, Rasch analysis supported the NSAA as a psychometrically robust scale for use in DMD clinical research and trials. This study also demonstrates how Rasch analysis is a useful instrument to detect and understand the key measurement issues of rating scales."

One hundred fifty-three DMD boys (573 assessments) younger than 6 years (mean: 4.68, SD: 0.84) with a genetically proven DMD diagnoses were included. Our results showed North Star Ambulatory Assessment scores progressively increased with age. The largest increase was observed between age 3 and 4 years but further increase was steadily observed until age of 6 years. Using a multiple linear regression analysis, we found that both the use of corticosteroids and the site of mutation significantly contributed to the North Star Ambulatory Assessment changes (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). At each age point, boys on corticosteroid treatment had higher scores than corticosteroid na\u00efve ones (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Similarly, patients with mutations downstream exon 44, had lower baseline scores and lower magnitude of changes compared to those with mutations located at the 5' end of the gene (p\u00a0<\u00a00,001). Very few boys achieved the age appropriate maximum score.

We studied 147 typically developing and 144 boys affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy between the ages of 3 and 5 years. More than 85% of the typically developing boys by the age of 4 years had full scores on all the items with total scores \u226533/34. Before the age of 4 years more than 15% of the typically developing boys did not achieve full scores on all the items. Some items, such as standing on one leg, showed significant improvement with age. In contrast, other activities were rarely achieved even in the older boys. Even if there was a progressive increase in scores with age, both total and individual item scores in Duchenne were still far from those obtained in the typically developing children of the same age. Our findings suggest that the North Star Ambulatory Assessment can be reliably used at least from the age of 4 years.

Skipping DMD exons using phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) is an emerging treatment strategy that can restore the reading frame of the mutated gene and produce truncated but functional dystrophin protein. To date, four PMOs, including eteplirsen, casimersen, viltolarsen, and golodirsen, have been conditionally approved by the FDA for the treatment of DMD. Since degeneration of muscle fibers and irreversible fibrosis occur from childhood, the earlier treatment is preferred. The canine X-linked muscular dystrophy in Japan (CXMDj), a dog model of DMD, produces no dystrophin and exhibits a severe phenotype similar to human patients from early childhood. As such, CXMDj, which harbors\u00a0a splice site mutation in intron 6, is a useful model for examining the long-term effects of early PMO treatment. In this chapter, we describe the systemic delivery of a cocktail of four PMOs that can successfully induce multiple exon skipping (exons 6-9) in neonatal\u00a0dystrophic dogs. We also describe the procedures to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity, including clinical grading of dystrophic dogs, ELISA-based quantification of PMOs, histology, RT-PCR, and western blotting."

Part 1 was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-titration study followed by 9-week safety review. Part 2 was a 168-week, open-label evaluation of golodirsen 30\u2009mg/kg. Part 1 primary endpoint was safety. Part 2 primary endpoints were dystrophin protein expression and 6-minute walk test (6MWT); secondary endpoints were percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%p) and safety. Post hoc ambulation analyses used mutation-matched external natural history controls. All patients from Part 1 (golodirsen, n\u2009=\u20098; placebo, n\u2009=\u20094) plus 13 additional patients entered Part 2; 23 completed the study. Adverse events were generally mild, nonserious, and unrelated to golodirsen, with no safety-related discontinuations or deaths. Golodirsen increased dystrophin protein (16.0-fold; P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001) and exon skipping (28.9-fold; P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001).

FVC%p declined 8.4% over 3 years in golodirsen-treated patients, comparing favorably with literature-reported rates. This study provides evidence for golodirsen biologic activity and long-term safety in a declining DMD population and suggests functional benefit versus external controls.

Loss-of-function mutations in the DMD gene, which codes for dystrophin, lead to this disease. The majority of mutations in this gene result in the exclusion of one or more exons from the transcript, eventually causing the remaining exons not to fit together correctly (i.e., out-of-frame mutations). Antisense oligonucleotides, e.g., phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), can induce therapeutic exon skipping during pre-mRNA processing to restore the reading frame of the primary transcript of DMD. As a result, truncated but partially functional dystrophin is produced, potentially slowing down the disease progression. Golodirsen is a provisionally approved PMO-based drug for approx. 8% of all DMD patients amenable to exon 53 skipping. This article summarizes golodirsen's pharmacology, efficacy and safety information. It also discusses some controversies that golodirsen met after the approval."

The between-group differences were principally attributable to rise from the floor velocity (0.06 rise/s [98.3% CI, 0.03 to 0.08 rise/s] for daily prednisone vs intermittent prednisone [P\u2009=\u2009.003]; 0.06 rise/s [98.3% CI, 0.03 to 0.09 rise/s] for daily deflazacort vs intermittent prednisone [P\u2009=\u2009.017]; and -0.004 rise/s [98.3% CI, -0.03 to 0.02 rise/s] for daily prednisone vs daily deflazacort [P\u2009=\u2009.75]). The pairwise comparisons for forced vital capacity and TSQM global satisfaction subscale score were not statistically significant. The most common adverse events were abnormal behavior (22 [34%] in the daily prednisone group, 25 [38%] in the daily deflazacort group, and 24 [36%] in the intermittent prednisone group), upper respiratory tract infection (24 [37%], 19 [29%], and 24 [36%], respectively), and vomiting (19 [29%], 17 [26%], and 15 [23%]).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, treatment with daily prednisone or daily deflazacort, compared with intermittent prednisone alternating 10 days on and 10 days off, resulted in significant improvement over 3 years in a composite outcome comprising measures of motor function, pulmonary function, and satisfaction with treatment; there was no significant difference between the 2 daily corticosteroid regimens. The findings support the use of a daily corticosteroid regimen over the intermittent prednisone regimen tested in this study as initial treatment for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01603407."

Both have been used off-label for many years (choice dependent on patient preference, cost, and geographic location) before FDA approval of deflazacort for DMD in 2017. In this review, we compare deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone in terms of their key pharmacological features, relative efficacy, and safety profiles in patients with DMD. Differentiating features include lipid solubility, pharmacokinetics, changes in gene expression profiles, affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor, and impact on glucose metabolism. Evidence from randomized clinical trials, prospective studies, meta-analyses, and post-hoc analyses suggests that patients receiving deflazacort experience similar or slower rates of functional decline compared with those receiving prednisone/prednisolone. Regarding side effects, weight gain and behavior side effects appear to be greater with prednisone/prednisolone than with deflazacort, whereas bone health, growth parameters, and cataracts appear worse with deflazacort."

The DMD-STEROID group was further subdivided into Deflazacort and prednisone groups. Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 expression microarrays were used to evaluate mRNA expression.

Viltolarsen, an exon 53 skipping therapy, has been shown to increase endogenous dystrophin levels. Herein, long-term (>2 years) functional outcomes in viltolarsen treated patients were compared to a matched historical control group.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of the anti-sense oligonucleotide viltolarsen in the treatment of patients with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping therapy.\nMETHODS: This trial (NCT03167255) is the extension of a previously published 24-week trial in North America (NCT02740972) that examined dystrophin levels, timed function tests compared to a matched historical control group (Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group Duchenne Natural History Study, CINRG DNHS), and safety in boys 4 to\u200a<\u200a10 years (N\u200a=\u200a16) with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping who were treated with viltolarsen. Both groups were treated with glucocorticoids. All 16 participants elected to enroll in this long-term trial (up to 192 weeks) to continue evaluation of motor function and safety.\nRESULTS: Time to stand from supine and time to run/walk 10 meters showed stabilization from baseline through week 109 for viltolarsen-treated participants whereas the historical control group showed decline (statistically significant differences for multiple timepoints). Safety was similar to that observed in the previous 24-week trial, which was predominantly mild. There have been no treatment-related serious adverse events and no discontinuations.\nCONCLUSIONS: Based on these results at over 2 years, viltolarsen can be a new treatment option for patients with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping."

In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, levosimendan, a calcium sensitiser, was shown to improve neuromechanical efficiency and contractile function of the human diaphragm. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral levosimendan in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, with a focus on respiratory function.\nMETHODS: The REFALS study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial at 99 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis specialist centres in 14 countries worldwide. People with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were eligible for participation if they were at least 18 years of age and had a sitting slow vital capacity (SVC) of 60-90% predicted. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) by interactive web-response system to receive either levosimendan or placebo. The capsules for oral administration were identical in appearance to maintain blinding of participants and investigators. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in supine SVC at 12 weeks, assessed as the percentage of predicted normal sitting SVC. The key secondary endpoint was the combined assessment of function and survival (CAFS) up to 48 weeks. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, comprising all participants who were randomly assigned. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03505021) and has been completed. An extension study (REFALS-ES; NCT03948178) has also been completed, but will be reported separately.\nFINDINGS: Between June 21, 2018, and June 28, 2019, 871 people were screened for the study, of whom 496 were randomly assigned either levosimendan (n=329) or placebo (n=167). Participants were followed up between June 27, 2018 and June 26, 2020, for a median duration of 50\u00b71 (IQR 37\u00b75-51\u00b71) weeks. The median duration of treatment was 47\u00b79 (IQR 26\u00b74-48\u00b71) weeks. Change from baseline in supine SVC at 12 weeks was -6\u00b773% with levosimendan and -6\u00b799% with placebo, with no significant difference between the treatments (estimated treatment difference 0\u00b726%, 95% CI -2\u00b703 to 2\u00b755, p=0\u00b783). Similarly, at week 48, CAFS did not differ between treatment groups (least squares mean change from baseline 10\u00b769, 95% CI -15\u00b774 to 37\u00b712; nominal p value=0\u00b743). The most frequent adverse events were increased heart rate (106 [33%] of 326 receiving levosimendan vs 12 [7%] of 166 receiving placebo), fall (85 [26%] vs 48 [29%]), headache (93 [29%] vs 36 [22%]), and dyspnoea (59 [18%] vs 32 [19%]). 33 (10%) participants allocated levosimendan and 20 (12%) assigned placebo died during the trial, mainly due to respiratory failure or progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\nINTERPRETATION: Levosimendan was not superior to placebo in maintaining respiratory function in a broad population with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Treatment varies but usually includes surgical management of symptoms. One patient required urgent urinary surgery; a vesicotomy was urgently performed due to anuria. These aspects explain the great diversity of opinions on the approach to this syndrome, but the severity of renal dysplasia is the main prognostic factor.

Longitudinal trajectories of SOMAscan\u00ae protein data obtained on serum of DMD boys aged 4 to 10 (Pred: n = 7; Dfz: n = 8) were analyzed after accounting for age and time on treatment. Out of the pre-specified biomarkers, seventeen candidate proteins were differentially altered between the two drugs (p &lt; 0.05). These include IGFBP-2 and AGER associated with diabetes complications, and MMP-3 associated with extracellular remodeling. As a follow-up, IGFBP-2, MMP-3, and IGF-I were quantified with an ELISA using a larger sample size of DMD biosamples (Dfz: n = 17, Pred: n = 12; up to 76 sera samples) over a longer treatment duration. MMP-3 and IGFBP-2 validated the SOMAscan\u00ae signal, however, IGF-I did not. This study identified GC-responsive biomarkers, some associated with safety, that highlight differential PD response between Dfz and Pred."

Glucocorticoid steroids such as prednisone and deflazacort are recommended for treating Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy where their use prolongs ambulation and life expectancy. Despite this benefit, glucocorticoid use in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is also associated with significant adverse consequences including adrenal suppression, growth impairment, poor bone health and metabolic syndrome. For other forms of muscular dystrophy like the limb girdle dystrophies, glucocorticoids are not typically used. Here we review the experimental evidence supporting multiple mechanisms of glucocorticoid action in dystrophic muscle including their role in dampening inflammation and myofiber injury. We also discuss alternative dosing strategies as well as novel steroid agents that are in development and testing, with the goal to reduce adverse consequences of prolonged glucocorticoid exposure while maximizing beneficial outcomes."

Glucocorticoids such as prednisone and deflazacort have powerful anti-inflammatory benefits and are the standard of care for DMD, but their long-term use can result in severe adverse side effects; thus, vamorolone was designed as a unique dissociative steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, to retain efficacy and minimise these adverse effects. Extensive clinical trials (ongoing) have investigated the use of vamorolone for DMD, with two trials also for limb-girdle muscular dystrophies including dysferlinopathy (current), plus a variety of pre-clinical trials published. Vamorolone looks very promising, with similar efficacy and some reduced adverse effects (e.g., related to height) compared with other glucocorticoids, specifically prednisone/prednisolone, although it has not yet been directly compared with deflazacort. Of particular interest to clarify is the optimal clinical dose and other aspects of vamorolone that are proposed to provide additional benefits for membranes of dystrophic muscle: to stabilise and protect the sarcolemma from damage and enhance repair. The use of vamorolone (and other glucocorticoids) needs to be evaluated in terms of overall long-term efficacy and cost, and also in comparison with many candidate non-steroidal drugs with anti-inflammatory and other benefits for DMD."

Shared pathological features among muscular dystrophies include breakdown, or loss of muscle, and accompanying fibrotic replacement. Novel strategies are needed to enhance muscle repair and function and to slow this pathological remodeling. Glucocorticoid steroids, like prednisone, are known to delay loss of ambulation in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy but are accompanied by prominent adverse effects. However, less is known about the effects of steroid administration in other types of muscular dystrophies, including limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs). LGMD 2B is caused by loss of dysferlin, a membrane repair protein, and LGMD 2C is caused by loss of the dystrophin-associated protein, \u03b3-sarcoglycan. Herein, we assessed the efficacy of steroid dosing on sarcolemmal repair, muscle function, histopathology, and the regenerative capacity of primary muscle cells. We found that in murine models of LGMD 2B and 2C, daily prednisone dosing reduced muscle damage and fibroinflammatory infiltration. However, daily prednisone dosing also correlated with increased muscle adipogenesis and atrophic remodeling. Conversely, intermittent dosing of prednisone, provided once weekly, enhanced muscle repair and did not induce atrophy or adipogenesis, and was associated with improved muscle function. These data indicate that dosing frequency of glucocorticoid steroids affects muscle remodeling in non-Duchenne muscular dystrophies, suggesting a positive outcome associated with intermittent steroid dosing in LGMD 2B and 2C muscle."

Both have been used off-label for many years (choice dependent on patient preference, cost, and geographic location) before FDA approval of deflazacort for DMD in 2017. In this review, we compare deflazacort and prednisone/prednisolone in terms of their key pharmacological features, relative efficacy, and safety profiles in patients with DMD. Differentiating features include lipid solubility, pharmacokinetics, changes in gene expression profiles, affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor, and impact on glucose metabolism. Evidence from randomized clinical trials, prospective studies, meta-analyses, and post-hoc analyses suggests that patients receiving deflazacort experience similar or slower rates of functional decline compared with those receiving prednisone/prednisolone. Regarding side effects, weight gain and behavior side effects appear to be greater with prednisone/prednisolone than with deflazacort, whereas bone health, growth parameters, and cataracts appear worse with deflazacort."

Despite the phenomenal advances made in the understanding of the molecular genetics of the disease, no definitive cure has been found. Of all of the therapeutic drugs studied in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, only prednisone seems to have the potential for providing interim functional improvement for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy while they wait for a cure with gene or cell therapy. There is still no consensus regarding recommending corticosteroids as standard therapy for boys. This is an evidence-based review of all of the studies of corticosteroids (prednisone, deflazacort, and oxandrolone) in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. From this review, it is clear that until a definitive treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is available, the use of deflazacort and prednisone with judicious dietary control and close clinical monitoring for side effects seems the best intervention for interim preservation of function in such a common devastating disorder of young growing boys."

Cognitive and behavioral symptoms occur in about one third of patients, and it is important to recognize and manage them promptly, developing an individualized plan at school and at home to maximize the patient's cognitive abilities. In the late phase of the disease, palliative care is of paramount importance. Corticosteroid therapy (prednisone and deflazacort) is the only effective pharmacologic treatment for DMD. Daily prednisone treatment increases muscle strength and function, improves pulmonary function, and significantly slows the progression of weakness. Deflazacort has a similar effect on muscle strength, but it is not available in the United States. Treatment with corticosteroid should be offered to all patients with DMD, but the beneficial effects and potential adverse effects should be fully discussed before treatment begins. The optimal dose of prednisone is 0.75 mg/kg per day, up to a maximum of 40 mg/d. If adverse effects occur, a decrease in dosage is appropriate. Monitoring of muscle function and adverse effects by a neurologist or neuromuscular specialist is strongly recommended. Physical and occupational therapists should be involved early in the treatment of patients with DMD to develop a program that includes heel cord stretching and exercise. In the later phases, these therapists can recommend adaptive equipment and maximize independence. Orthopedic consultation is important in monitoring and managing scoliosis and joint contractures in the nonambulatory phase of the disease. Pulmonary evaluation for ventilatory care is important; pulmonary consultation is essential when vital capacity declines. The use of assistive cough devices, nasal bilevel positive airway pressure, and tracheostomy must be discussed with patients and their families. For all patients with DMD, particularly those receiving prednisone, consultation with a dietitian is very helpful to control weight and maintain a healthy diet."

The Cincinnati study reviewed data from 435 males with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, also known as DMD, who were treated at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. DMD is a rare disease that worsens over time. People with DMD experience inflammation in their muscles and muscle loss over time. They also experience bone problems such as an abnormally bent spine, also known as scoliosis, as well as heart and lung problems.\nWHAT HAPPENED IN THE CINCINNATI STUDY?: Prednisone and deflazacort are steroids that help to reduce muscle inflammation and are used as treatments for DMD. The study researchers wanted to further understand the differences between using prednisone and deflazacort in males with DMD by reviewing data from past medical records of patients seen in clinics rather than in clinical studies. This is known as gathering real-world evidence. In the Cincinnati study, the researchers compared males with DMD who started taking prednisone as their first steroid treatment with males who started taking deflazacort as their first steroid treatment.\nWHAT WERE THE RESULTS?: Overall, the researchers found that the participants who took deflazacort were able to walk until a later age before they needed to use a wheelchair, compared with those who took prednisone. They also had a lower risk of scoliosis and developed it at a later age.\nWHAT DO THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY MEAN?: These results helped the researchers to learn more about the differences between how well prednisone and deflazacort work in males with DMD based on their medical records."

We analysed 598 boys, with 2604 observations. This analysis considered patients from the UK NorthStar database (2003-2020) on one of five regimes: \"GC na\u00efve\", \"deflazacort daily\" (DD), \"deflazacort intermittent\" (DI), \"prednisolone daily\" (PD) and \"prednisolone intermittent\" (PI). A random slope model was used to model the weight, height and BMI SD scores (using the UK90).\nRESULTS: The daily regime subgroups had significant yearly height stunting compared to the GC na\u00efve subgroup. Notably, the average height change for the DD subgroup was 0.25 SD (95% CI -\u20090.30, -\u20090.21) less than reference values. Those with affected expression of Dp427, Dp140 and Dp71 isoforms were 0.77 (95% CI 0.3, 1.24) and 0.82 (95% CI 1.28, 0.36) SD shorter than those with Dp427 and/or Dp140 expression affected respectively. Increased weight was not associated with earlier loss of ambulation, but taller boys still ambulant between the age of 10 and 11\u00a0years were more at risk of losing ambulation.\nCONCLUSION: These findings may provide further guidance to clinicians when counselling and discussing GCs commencement with patients and their carers and may represent a benchmark set of data to evaluate the effects of new generations of GC."

Prednisone therapy, daily or on alternate days, has been confirmed to be of value in enhancing muscle strength and function in DMD for up to two years. However, there is evidence that corticosteroid treatment results in muscle weakness and degeneration. This review, therefore, examines the available studies and addresses various possible mechanisms involved in the efficacy of prednisone therapy and amelioration of DMD. The progression of DMD is known to be associated with profound changes in structure, biochemistry and physiology of the affected muscles. It is hypothesized, therefore, that these very changes offer a fortunate set of circumstances, and it is owing to these alterations, as well as the well known anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive action of steroid, that muscles in DMD are rendered responsive resulting in significant improvement of muscle bulk and function."

Mutations in complex V genes of the respiratory chain were considered until recently as the most frequent cause for mitochondrial inherited Leigh syndrome, while gene defects in complex I were related to recessive Leigh syndrome. Recently few reports of mutations in the mitochondrial-encoded complex I subunit genes causing Leigh syndrome have been reported. We describe a 1-month-old baby who acutely deteriorated, with abrupt onset of brainstem dysfunction, due to basal ganglia lesions extending to the brainstem. A muscle biopsy demonstrated complex I deficiency. Subsequent analysis of the mitochondrial genome revealed a homoplastic T10191C mutation in the ND3 gene (in blood and muscle), resulting in a substitution of serine to proline. Hair root analysis revealed a 50% mutant load, reflecting heteroplasmy in early embryonic stages. The mutation was also detected in his mother (5%). Western blot analysis revealed a decrease of the 20 kDa subunit (likely ND6) and of the 30 kDa subunit (NDUFA9), which is probably due to instability attributed to the inability to form subcomplexes with ND3. This is the first description of infantile Leigh syndrome due to a maternally transmitted T10191C substitution in ND3 and not due to a de novo mutation. This mutation is age and tissue dependent and therefore may not be amenable to prenatal testing."

To investigate to what extent SURF-1 is responsible for human disorders because of COX deficiency, we undertook sequence analysis of the SURF-1 gene in 46 unrelated patients. We analyzed 24 COX-defective patients classified as having typical Leigh syndrome (LS(COX)), 6 patients classified as Leigh-like (LL(COX)) cases, and 16 patients classified as non-LS(COX) cases. Frameshift, stop, and splice mutations of SURF-1 were detected in 18 of 24 (75%) of the LS(COX) cases. No mutations were found in the LL(COX) and non-LS(COX) group of patients. Rescue of the COX phenotype was observed in transfected cells from patients harboring SURF-1 mutations, but not in transfected cell lines from 2 patients in whom no mutations were detected by sequence analysis. Loss of function of SURF-1 protein is specifically associated with LS(COX), although a proportion of LS(COX) cases must be the result of abnormalities in genes other than SURF-1. SURF-1 is the first nuclear gene to be consistently mutated in a major category of respiratory chain defects. DNA analysis can now be used to accurately diagnose LS(COX), a common subtype of Leigh syndrome."

We have investigated five patients with different SURF1 mutations resulting in the absence of Surf1 protein. All of them presented with severe and generalised COX defect. Immunoelectrophoretic analysis of cultured fibroblasts revealed 85% decrease of the normal-size COX complexes and significant accumulation of incomplete COX assemblies of 90-120 kDa. Spectrophotometric assay of COX activity showed a 70-90% decrease in lauryl maltoside (LM)-solubilised fibroblasts. In contrast, oxygen consumption analysis in whole cells revealed only a 13-31% decrease of COX activity, which was completely inhibited by detergent in patient cells but not in controls. In patient fibroblasts ADP-stimulated respiration was 50% decreased and cytofluorometry showed a significant decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential DeltaPsi(m) in state 4, as well as a 2.4-fold higher sensitivity of DeltaPsi(m) to uncoupler. We conclude that the absence of the Surf1 protein leads to the formation of incomplete COX complexes, which in situ maintain rather high electron-transport activity, while their H(+)-pumping is impaired. Enzyme inactivation by the detergent in patient cells indicates instability of incomplete COX assemblies."

As opposed to other causes of Leigh syndrome, early administration of thiamine and biotin has a dramatic and immediate clinical effect. New biochemical markers are needed to aid in early diagnosis and timely therapeutic intervention. Thiamine derivatives were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography in 106 whole blood and 38 cerebrospinal fluid samples from paediatric controls, 16 cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients with Leigh syndrome, six of whom harboured mutations in the SLC19A3 gene, and 49 patients with other neurological disorders. Free-thiamine was remarkably reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid of five SLC19A3 patients before treatment. In contrast, free-thiamine was slightly decreased in 15.2% of patients with other neurological conditions, and above the reference range in one SLC19A3 patient on thiamine supplementation. We also observed a severe deficiency of free-thiamine and low levels of thiamine diphosphate in fibroblasts from SLC19A3 patients. Surprisingly, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and mitochondrial substrate oxidation rates were within the control range. Thiamine derivatives normalized after the addition of thiamine to the culture medium. In conclusion, we found a profound deficiency of free-thiamine in the CSF and fibroblasts of patients with thiamine transporter-2 deficiency. Thiamine supplementation led to clinical improvement in patients early treated and restored thiamine values in fibroblasts and cerebrospinal fluid."

The present study reported a case of childhood Leigh syndrome with a point mutation at bp 8,993 in the mitochondrial ATPase6 gene. A 21\u2011month\u2011old male child had developed epilepsy, muscular weakness and vomiting, which was accompanied by high fever. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated typical characteristics of Leigh syndrome, including a symmetric abnormal signal in the dorsal medulla oblongata and Sylvian fissure enlargement in association with an abnormal signal in the periventricular white matter and in the putamina and caudate heads. The diagnosis was further supported with genetic tests including polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), sequencing, and quantitative PCR. The patient was found to carry a mitochondrial T8993C (m.T8993C) mutation in peripheral blood with 94.00\u00b11.34% heteroplasmy. Eight of his relatives were also subjected to quantification of the m.T8993C mutation. The percentages of heteroplasmy in samples taken from the grandmother, mother, aunt, cousin 1, and cousin 2 were 16.33\u00b11.67, 66.81\u00b10.85, 71.66\u00b13.22, 87.00\u00b11.79, and 91.24\u00b12.50%, respectively. The mutation was not found in samples taken from the father, the husband of the aunt, or the grandfather of the patient. The obtained data showed that the mutation was maternally inherited and accumulated through generations. Even though the heteroplasmy levels of his mother, aunt, cousin 1, and cousin\u00a02 were relatively high (66.81\u201191.24%), they remained asymptomatic, indicating that the threshold at which this mutation shows effects is high. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a case of Leigh syndrome in a Vietnamese individual harboring a mtDNA mutation at the 8,993\u00a0bp site, and showing a correlation between the heteroplasmy and clinical phenotype. These findings may be useful in helping to improve the clinical diagnosis and treatment of Leigh syndrome."

Pathogenic variants in the MT-ND1 (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 1) gene that result in Complex I dysfunction are a known cause of Leigh syndrome. The patient is a 4-yr-old female who initially presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, with other symptoms of Leigh syndrome becoming apparent after the seizures. A three-generation pedigree revealed no family history of mitochondrial disorders. Laboratory studies were remarkable for elevated blood lactate, alanine, and GDF15. T<sub>2</sub>-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral asymmetric signal hyperintensities in the basal ganglia, specifically in the bilateral putamen and right caudate. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed regionally elevated glucose and lactate. Mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme analysis on skin fibroblasts demonstrated slightly reduced Complex I function. A 16-gene dystonia panel and chromosomal microarray analysis did not identify any disease-causing variants. Combined exome and mitochondrial genome sequencing identified the m.3685T &gt; C (MT-ND1 p.Tyr127His) variant with 62.3% heteroplasmy with no alternative cause for the patient's condition. Mitochondrial genome sequencing of the mother demonstrated that the m.3685T &gt; C variant occurred de novo. The m.3685T &gt; C variant is absent from population databases. The tyrosine 127 residue is highly conserved, and several nearby pathogenic variants in the MT-ND1 gene have been previously associated with Leigh syndrome. We propose that the m.3685T &gt; C variant is a novel mitochondrial DNA variant that causes Leigh syndrome, and we classify this variant as likely pathogenic based on currently available information."

Leigh syndrome is the most common clinical presentation of pediatric mitochondrial disease, typically appearing in the first few years of life, and involving severe multisystem pathologies. Clinical care for Leigh syndrome patients is difficult, complicated by the wide range of symptoms including characteristic progressive CNS lesion, metabolic sequelae, and epileptic seizures, which can be intractable to standard management. While no proven therapies yet exist for the underlying mitochondrial disease, a ketogenic diet has led to some reports of success in managing mitochondrial epilepsies, with ketosis reducing seizure risk and severity. The impact of ketosis on other aspects of disease progression in Leigh syndrome has not been studied, however, and a rigorous study of the impact of ketosis on seizures in mitochondrial disease is lacking. Conversely, preclinical efforts have identified the intracellular nutrient signaling regulator mTOR as a promising therapeutic target, with data suggesting the benefits are mediated by metabolic changes. mTOR inhibition alleviates epilepsies arising from defects in TSC, an mTOR regulator, but the therapeutic potential of mTOR inhibition in seizures related to primary mitochondrial dysfunction is unknown. Given that ketogenic diet is used clinically in the setting of mitochondrial disease, and mTOR inhibition is in clinical trials for intractable pediatric epilepsies of diverse causal origins, a direct experimental assessment of their effects is imperative. Here, we define the impact of dietary ketosis on survival and CNS disease in the Ndufs4(KO) mouse model of Leigh syndrome and the therapeutic potential of both dietary ketosis and mTOR inhibition on seizures in this model. These data provide timely insight into two important clinical interventions."

For most patients the genetic cause of the biochemical defect remains unknown due to incomplete understanding of the complex I assembly process. Nonetheless, a plethora of pathogenic mutations have been described to date in the seven mitochondrial-encoded subunits of complex I as well as in 12 of the nuclear-encoded subunits and in six assembly factors. Whilst several mitochondrial DNA mutations are recurrent, the majority of these mutations are reported in single families. We have sequenced core structural and functional nuclear-encoded subunits of complex I in a cohort of 34 paediatric patients with isolated complex I deficiency, identifying pathogenic mutations in 6 patients. These included a novel homozygous NDUFS1 mutation in an Asian child with Leigh syndrome, a previously identified NDUFS8 mutation (c.236C>T, p.P79L) in a second Asian child with Leigh-like syndrome and six novel, compound heterozygous NDUFS2 mutations in four white Caucasian patients with Leigh or Leigh-like syndrome. Three of these children harboured an identical NDUFS2 mutation (c.875T>C, p.M292T), which was also identified in conjunction with a novel NDUFS2 splice site mutation (c.866+4A>G) in a fourth Caucasian child who presented to a different diagnostic centre, with microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism analyses indicating that this was due to an ancient common founder event. Our results confirm that NDUFS2 is a mutational hotspot in Caucasian children with isolated complex I deficiency and recommend the routine diagnostic investigation of this gene in patients with Leigh or Leigh-like phenotypes."

Most of the reported mutations create premature termination codons, whereas missense mutations are rare. The aim of the study was to characterize the natural history of LS patients carrying at least one missense mutation in the SURF1 gene. Nineteen such patients (8 own cases and 11 reported in the literature) were compared with a reference group of 20 own c.845_846delCT homozygous patients, and with other LS(SURF-) cases described in the literature. Disease onset in the studied group was delayed. Acute failure to thrive and hyperventilation episodes were rare, respiratory failure did not appear before the age of 4 years. Dystonia, motor regression and eye movement dissociation developed slowly. The number of patients who survived 7 years of life totaled 9 out of 15 (60%) in the 'missense group' and 1 out of 26 (4%) patients with mutations leading to truncated proteins.\nIN CONCLUSION: (i) The presence of a missense mutation in the SURF1 gene may correlate with a milder course and longer survival of Leigh patients, (ii) normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, normal blood lactate value, and only mild decrease of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity are not sufficient reasons to forego SURF1 mutation analysis in differential diagnosis."

The proband was the first child of his parents. The previously healthy boy presented with generalized epilepsy at 12 years of age.

Her early development was delayed, and from age 2 years she started losing motor abilities. Cerebral MRI showed basal ganglia lesions typical of Leigh syndrome.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: A genome-wide search for homozygosity was performed with the Affymetrix GeneChip 50K Xba array. The analysis revealed several homozygous regions. Three candidate genes were identified, and in one of the genes, NDUFA12, a homozygous c.178C\u2192T mutation leading to a premature stop codon (p.Arg60X) was found. Western blot analysis showed absence of NDUFA12 protein in patient fibroblasts and functional complementation by a baculovirus system showed restoration of complex I activity.\nCONCLUSION: NDUFA12 mutations are apparently not a frequent cause of complex I deficiency, since mutations were not found by screening altogether 122 complex I deficient patients in two different studies. NDUFA12 encodes an accessory subunit of complex I and is a paralogue of NDUFAF2. Despite the complete absence of NDUFA12 protein, a fully assembled and enzymatically active complex I could be found, albeit in reduced amounts. This suggests that NDUFA12 is required either at a late step in the assembly of complex I, or in the stability of complex I."

As such, genetically determined mitochondrial diseases may result from a molecular defect involving the mitochondrial or the nuclear genome. The first is characterized by maternal inheritance and the second by Mendelian inheritance. Ragged-red fibers (RRF) are commonly seen with primary lesions of mtDNA, but this association is not invariant. Conversely, RRF are seldom associated with primary lesions of nuclear DNA. Large-scale rearrangements (deletions and insertions) and point mutations of mtDNA are commonly associated with RRF and lactic acidosis, e.g. Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) (major large-scale rearrangements), Pearson syndrome (large-scale rearrangements), myoclonus epilepsy with RRF (MERRF) (point mutation affecting tRNA(lys) gene), mitochondrial myopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) (two point mutations affecting tRNA(leu)(UUR) gene) and a maternally-inherited myopathy with cardiac involvement (MIMyCa) (point mutation affecting tRNA(leu)(UUR) gene). However, RRF and lactic acidosis are absent in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) (one point mutation affecting ND4 gene, two point mutations affecting ND1 gene, and one point mutation affecting the apocytochrome b subunit of complex III), and the condition associated with maternally inherited sensory neuropathy (N), ataxia (A), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), developmental delay, dementia, seizures, and limb weakness (NARP) (point mutation affecting ATPase subunit 6 gene). The point mutations in MELAS, MIMyCa, and MERRF, and the large-scale mtDNA rearrangements in KSS and Pearson syndrome have a broader biochemical impact since these molecular defects involve the translational sequence of mitochondrial protein synthesis. The nuclear defects involving mitochondrial function generally are not associated with RRF. The biochemical classification of mitochondrial diseases principally catalogues these nuclear defects. This classification divides mitochondrial diseases into five categories. Primary and secondary deficiencies of carnitine are examples of a substrate transport defect. A lipid storage myopathy is often present. Disturbances of pyruvate or fatty acid metabolism are examples of substrate utilization defects. Only four defects of the Krebs cycle are known: fumarase deficiency, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase deficiency, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase deficiency, and combined defects of muscle succinate dehydrogenase and aconitase. Luft disease is the singular example of a defect in oxidation-phosphorylation coupling. Defects of respiratory chain function are manifold. Two clinical syndromes predominate, one involving limb weakness, and the other primarily affecting brain function. Leigh syndrome may result from different enzyme defects, most notably pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, complex I deficiency, and complex V deficiency associated with the recently described NARP point mutation. A new group of mitochondrial diseases has emerged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

A computational model accounting for all major pathways in fibroblast metabolism (including 430 metabolites and 508 reactions) is built to determine the metabolic steady states of the normal and Leigh's cell lines based on measured substrate uptake and secretion rates and isotopomer data. Results show that (i) Leigh's syndrome affected cells have slower metabolism than control fibroblasts as evidenced by their overall slower substrate utilization and lower secretion of end products; (ii) intracellular fluxes predicted by the models, some of which are validated by biochemical studies published in the literature, show that the respiratory chain in Leigh's affected cells can produce ATP at a similar rate as the controls, but with a more restricted flux range; and (iii) mutations causing the defects observed in the Leigh's cells are likely to be in succinate cytochrome c reductase."

Recent studies in white patients indicate that SURF-1 gene mutations can cause Leigh syndrome associated with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. When we measured cytochrome c oxidase activity in cultured lymphoblastoid cells from our Japanese patients with typical Leigh syndrome, three patients demonstrated cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. Three novel mutations of the SURF-1 gene were identified in two of these three patients with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. All mutations predicted loss of function of the SURF-1 protein; in both patients' cells, cytochrome c oxidase activity was decreased to less than 20% of the control mean. These results indicate that cultured lymphoblastoid cells are useful for elucidating the etiology of Leigh syndrome, and that loss of function of the SURF-1 gene product can be responsible for Leigh syndrome associated with severe cytochrome c oxidase deficiency in Japanese patients."

The syndrome is characterized by subacute episodic decompensations, transiently elevated lactate, and necrotizing brain lesions most often in the striatum and brainstem. Acute decompensation is often triggered by viral infections. Sequalae from repeated episodes leads to progressive neurological deterioration and death. The severity of Leigh syndrome varies widely, from a rapid demise in childhood to rare adult presentations. Although the causes of Leigh syndrome include genes affecting a variety of different pathways, more than 75 of them are nuclear or mitochondrial encoded genes involved in the assembly and catalytic activity of mitochondrial respiratory complex I. Here we report the detailed clinical and molecular phenotype of two adults with mild presentations of NDUFS3 and NDUFAF6-related Leigh Syndrome. Mitochondrial assays revealed slightly reduced complex I activity in one proband and normal complex I activity in the other. The proband with NDUFS3-related Leigh syndrome was mildly affected and lived into adulthood with novel biallelic variants causing aberrant mRNA splicing (NM_004551.2:c.419G\u00a0>\u00a0A; p.Arg140Gln; NM_004551.2:c.381\u00a0+\u00a06\u00a0T\u00a0>\u00a0C).

The mild phenotypes of these two individuals may be attributed to some residual production of normal NDUFS3 and NDUFAF6 proteins by NDUFS3 and NDUFAF6 mRNA isoforms alongside mutant transcripts. Taken together, these cases reported herein suggest that splice-regulatory variants to complex I proteins could result in milder phenotypes."

We previously demonstrated the nuclear origin of the COX defect in one case, by fusing nuclear DNA-less cytoplasts derived from normal fibroblasts with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-less transformant fibroblasts derived from a patient with COX-defective [COX(-)] Leigh's syndrome. The resulting cybrid line showed a specific and serve COX(-) phenotype. Conversely, in the present study, we demonstrated that a COX(+) phenotype could be restored in hybrids obtained by fusing COX(-) transformant fibroblasts of seven additional Leigh's syndrome patients with mtDNA-less, COX(-) tumor-derived rho degree cells. Both these results are explained by the presence of a mutation in a nuclear gene. In a second set of experiments, in order to demonstrate whether COX(-) Leigh's syndrome is due to a defect in the same gene, or in different genes, we tested several hybrids derived by fusing our original COX(-) cell line with each of the remaining seven cell lines. COX activity was evaluated in situ by histochemical techniques and in cell extracts by a spectrophotometric assay. No COX complementers were found among the resulting hybrid lines. This result demonstrates that all our cases were genetically homogeneous, and suggests that a major nuclear disease locus is associated with several, perhaps most, of the cases of infantile COX(-) Leigh's syndrome.

Recently, an increasing number of mutations in mitochondrial DNA encoding regions, especially in NADH dehydrogenase (respiratory chain complex I) subunits, have been reported as causative of early onset Leigh syndrome. We describe a patient whose fetal brain ultrasound demonstrated periventricular pseudocyst suggestive of a possible mitochondrial disorder who presented postnatally with Leigh syndrome. A muscle biopsy demonstrated a partial decrease in complex I and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH-E1 alpha) activity. Sequencing of the PDH-E1 alpha gene did not reveal any mutation. Sequencing of the mtDNA revealed a novel heteroplasmic G10254A (D66N) mutation in the ND3 gene. This change results in a substitution of aspartic acid to asparagine in a highly conserved domain of the ND3 subunit. The mutation could not be detected in the mother's blood or urine sediment. Blue native gel electrophoresis of muscle mitochondria revealed a normal size, albeit a decreased level of complex I. The G10254A substitution in the mtDNA-ND3 gene is another cause of maternally inherited Leigh syndrome. This case demonstrates that periventricular pseudocysts may be the initial in utero presentation in patients with mitochondrial disorders.

We assume that the primary harmful factor is hypocapnia (decrease in pCO<sub>2</sub>) and respiratory alkalosis (increase in pH) due to hyperventilation, permanent or in response to stress. Inside mitochondria, the pH signal of high pH/low bicarbonate ion (HCO-<sub>3</sub>) is transmitted by soluble adenyl cyclase (sAC) through cAMP dependent manner. The process can initiate brain lesions (necrosis, apoptosis, hypervascularity) in OXPHOS deficient cells residing at the LS area of the brain. The major message of the article is that it is not the ATP depletion but intracellular alkalization (and/or hyperoxia?) which seem to be the cause of LS.

Known genetic causes, including defects of 16 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes and approaching 100 nuclear genes, are categorized into disorders of subunits and assembly factors of the five oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, disorders of pyruvate metabolism and vitamin and cofactor transport and metabolism, disorders of mtDNA maintenance, and defects of mitochondrial gene expression, protein quality control, lipid remodeling, dynamics, and toxicity. An approach to diagnosis is presented, together with known treatable causes and an overview of current supportive management options and emerging therapies on the horizon."

The aim of the study was to assess 24 month PUL changes in a large cohort of DMD patients and to establish whether domains changes occur more frequently in specific functional subgroups.\nMETHODS: The PUL was performed in 311 patients who had at least one pair of assessments at 24 months, for a total of 808 paired assessments. Ambulant patients were subdivided according to the ability to walk: >350, 250-350, \u2264250 meters. Non ambulant patients were subdivided according to the time since they lost ambulation: <1, 1-2, 2-5 or >5 years.\nRESULTS: At 12 months, the mean PUL 2.0 change on all the paired assessments was -1.30 (-1.51--1.05) for the total score, -0.5 (-0.66--0.39) for the shoulder domain, -0.6 (-0.74--0.5) for the elbow domain and -0.1 (-0.20--0.06) for the distal domain.At 24 months, the mean PUL 2.0 change on all the paired assessments was -2.9 (-3.29--2.60) for the total score, -1.30 (-1.47--1.09) for the shoulder domain, -1.30 (-1.45--1.11) for the elbow domain and -0.4 (-1.48--1.29) for the distal domain.Changes at 12 and 24 months were statistically significant between subgroups with different functional abilities for the total score and each domain (p\u200a<\u200a0.001).\nCONCLUSION: There were different patterns of changes among the functional subgroups in the individual domains. The time of transition, including the year before and after loss of ambulation, show the peak of negative changes in PUL total scores that reflect not only loss of shoulder but also of elbow activities. These results suggest that patterns of changes should be considered at the time of designing clinical trials."

Movement behavior was assessed while the participant engaged in everyday activities using a 17-sensor bodysuit during three clinical visits over the course of 12 months. We first defined new movement behavioral fingerprints capable of distinguishing DMD from controls. Then, we used machine learning algorithms that combined the behavioral fingerprints to make cross-sectional and longitudinal disease course predictions, which outperformed predictions derived from currently used clinical assessments. Finally, using Bayesian optimization, we constructed a behavioral biomarker, termed the KineDMD ethomic biomarker, which is derived from daily-life behavioral data and whose value progresses with age in an S-shaped sigmoid curve form. The biomarker developed in this study, derived from digital readouts of daily-life movement behavior, can predict disease progression in patients with muscular dystrophy and can potentially track the response to therapy."

Variation in clinical presentation, the rate of disease progression, and treatment responsiveness have been observed amongst DMD patients, suggesting that factors beyond the loss of dystrophin may contribute to DMD pathophysiology. Epigenetic mechanisms are becoming recognized as important factors implicated in the etiology and progression of various diseases. A growing number of genetic syndromes have been associated with unique genomic DNA methylation patterns (called \"episignatures\") that can be used for diagnostic testing and as disease biomarkers. To further investigate DMD pathophysiology, we assessed the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of peripheral blood from 36 patients with DMD using the combination of Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC bead chip array and EpiSign technology. We identified a unique episignature for DMD that whose specificity was confirmed in relation other neurodevelopmental disorders with known episignatures. By modeling the DMD episignature, we developed a new DMD episignature biomarker and provided novel insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disorder, which have the potential to advance more effective, personalized approaches to DMD care."

However, it is not clear which dysphagia-related factors should prompt introduction of alternative nutrition (AN). We aimed to determine which patients with DMD were introduced to AN.\nMETHODS: This retrospective study included 56 patients with DMD (median age, 23.5\u2009years). They were divided into patients able to continue oral feeding (OF) and those introduced to AN. Body weight, frequency of ventilator use, daily meals, history of steroid treatment, results of videofluoroscopic examination of swallowing (VF), and awareness of dysphagia were evaluated.\nRESULTS: Of 56 patients, 19 were in the AN group. After AN introduction, 93% of the patients continued oral intake. The proportion of patients who consumed chopped and liquid diets was higher, and body weight was lower, in the AN than in the OF group. There were no significant differences in age, upper limb function of feeding, frequency of ventilator use, or history of steroid therapy between the two groups. The frequencies of aspiration and residue in the pyriform sinus in VF were higher in the AN group than in the OF group. Decision-tree analysis showed that food form and subjective difficulty swallowing solid foods were the most important factors affecting the decision-making for AN.\nDISCUSSION: Patients with DMD who had difficulty eating solid foods were started on AN because they were unable to maintain their weight. These findings provide information for future longitudinal studies to assess the value of AN."

Our research objective was to delineate the clinical characteristics of this particular cohort and identify novel challenges associated with the disease.\nMETHODS: Nineteen individuals aged 25-48\u2009years (median 34\u2009years) with a confirmed diagnosis of out-of-frame DMD gene mutation were selected.\nRESULTS: All patients were mechanically ventilated (5/19 via tracheostomy), with different patterns of cardiomyopathy. Swallowing and nutritional issues were frequent (median body mass index 18.95), with six cases requiring artificial enteral feeding (median age at start 29\u2009years), as well as bone density alterations (11/19, 58%). Only 2/19 had been on long-term prednisone therapy. Issues requiring at-home/hospital assistance were respiratory infections (15/19, 79%), gastroenterological symptoms (9/19, 47%, including toxic megacolon and rectal perforation after repeated enemas), metabolic acidosis (2/19, 11%) and recurrent ischaemic strokes (1/19, 5%). From a social perspective, augmented-alternative communication devices were necessary for 7/19 (37%), with most of the patients being assisted at home and 2/19 institutionalized. Eight/19 (42%) patients experienced psychiatric symptoms (median age at presentation 16\u2009years) and 9/19 (47%) chronic pain (median age at onset 23\u2009years), in both cases treated with psychoactive/analgesic drugs without major adverse events. The patients' subjective perception of physical health resulted in unfavourable scores, whilst the subjective assessment of mental health unexpectedly showed more positive values compared to other chronic neurological conditions.\nCONCLUSIONS: The analysis of adults living with DMD reveals several new health-related issues, such as the management of emergencies and safety of pharmacological treatments for psychiatric symptoms, chronic pain management, as well as an increasing caregivers burden."

Observational studies that determined the prevalence of IDD in the population with BMD or DMD were included. Meta-analyses of IDD prevalence and prevalence ratios of the IDD-genotype association were conducted.\nRESULTS: Forty-nine studies were included. The prevalence of IDD in BMD was 8.0% (95% confidence interval 5.0-11.0), and in DMD it was 22.0% (18.0-27.0). Meta-analyses of IDD-genotype association showed a deleterious association between IDD and the number of isoforms affected in DMD, with a prevalence ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.43 (0.28-0.64) and 0.17 (0.09-0.34) for Dp140+ /Dp71+ versus Dp140- /Dp71+ and Dp140+ /Dp71+ versus Dp140- /Dp71- comparisons respectively.

FRDA is characterized by ataxia, loss of gait, scoliosis, cardiomyopathy, dysarthria and dysphagia, with reduced life expectancy. The disease onset is usually in adolescence, leading to progressive disability. Omaveloxolone has been recently approved as the first pharmacological treatment for FRDA in adults and adolescents aged 16\u2009years and older. Regarding non-pharmacological therapies, neurorehabilitation is a valuable aid in addressing the symptoms and in maintaining the residual functioning. We performed a prospective observational cohort study to evaluate the efficacy of inpatient rehabilitation (IR) for people with FRDA.\nMETHODS: A total of 42 individuals (29 adults and 13 children) with FRDA were recruited. There were 27 ambulant and 15 non-ambulant participants. The patients underwent IR of 3 and 4\u2009weeks in children and adults, respectively. The IR treatment was designed to be applied within a multidisciplinary setting, so FRDA patients underwent, in addition to physiotherapy, also occupational therapy, practical manual activities and psychological support aiming to enhance transferable skills useful in the activities of daily living. The primary outcome was the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). Other measures were: Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) and Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT). Furthermore, we used the 6\u2009Minute Walk Test (6MWT), the Timed Up and Go (TUG) and the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) only on ambulant subjects. Outcomes were evaluated at baseline and at the end of the treatment.\nRESULTS: We report that the IR significantly improves motor performance and ataxia symptoms in patients with FRDA. Our study shows significant functional improvement in all the outcome measures used, except for NHPT bilaterally. FARS and SARA scores post-IR are significatively reduced when compared (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001).\nDISCUSSION: We demonstrate that IR programs in FRDA can provide a meaningful clinical improvement in terms of outcome measures. These findings could be useful when approaching progressive neurological disorders."

We provide an update review on this subject highlighting important research findings from the last two years.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Recently, the use of omaveloxolone for 2\u200ayears significantly improved upright stability in Friedreich's ataxia patients. In an open-label study, N-acetyl-l-leucine administered for 6-weeks significantly improved clinical impression of change, ataxia, and quality of life in patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C1. A 12-week treatment with dalfampridine was associated with improved standing balance in a subgroup of patients with multiple sclerosis. A gluten-free diet alone improved ataxia in half of patients with antiglutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) ataxia, suggesting that gluten sensitivity might be part of the underlying pathogenesis in anti-GAD ataxia. In a head-to-head trial, both prolonged-release 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and acetazolamide effectively reduced the attacks up to 60% in patients with episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), albeit 4-AP had fewer adverse effects. Small observational studies have shown that patients with episodic vestibular syndrome who cannot be diagnosed as definite or probable vestibular migraine, might still improve vestibular symptoms following preventive treatment for migraine. The use of vitamin D supplementation in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, steroids in acute unilateral vestibulopathy, and betahistine in M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease patients remains controversial.\nSUMMARY: Although the use of several therapies is being established in the treatment of cerebellar and vestibular disorders, there is an urgent need for prospective controlled therapeutic trials."

To understand the utility of this study in analysis of clinical trials, we performed a propensity-matched comparison of data from the open-label MOXIe extension (omaveloxolone) to that from FACOMS.\nMETHODS: MOXIe extension patients were matched to FACOMS patients using logistic regression to estimate propensity scores based on multiple covariates: sex, baseline age, age of onset, baseline modified Friedreich Ataxia Rating scale (mFARS) score, and baseline gait score. The change from baseline in mFARS at Year 3 for the MOXIe extension patients compared to the matched FACOMS patients was analyzed as the primary efficacy endpoint using mixed model repeated measures analysis.\nRESULTS: Data from the MOXIe extension show that omaveloxolone provided persistent benefit over 3\u2009years when compared to an untreated, matched cohort from FACOMS. At each year, in all analysis populations, patients in the MOXIe extension experienced a smaller change from baseline in mFARS score than matched FACOMS patients. In the primary pooled population (136 patients in each group) by Year 3, patients in the FACOMS matched set progressed 6.6 points whereas patients treated with omaveloxolone in MOXIe extension progressed 3 points (difference\u2009=\u2009-3.6; nominal p value\u2009=\u20090.0001).\nINTERPRETATION: These results suggest a meaningful slowing of Friedreich ataxia progression with omaveloxolone, and consequently detail how propensity-matched analysis may contribute to understanding of effects of therapeutic agents.

It has garnered significant attention as a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). Although progress has been achieved in strategies to regulate the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, the availability of Nrf2 activators applicable to NDD is currently limited. Currently, the FDA has approved the Nrf2 activators dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and Omaveloxolone (Omav) as novel first-line oral drugs for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis and Friedreich's ataxia. A promising alternative approach involves the direct inhibition of Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interactions (PPI), which offers numerous advantages over the use of electrophilic Nrf2 activators, primarily in avoiding off-target effects. This review examines the compelling evidence supporting the beneficial role of Nrf2 in NDD and explores the potential of Keap1 inhibitors and Keap1-Nrf2 PPI inhibitors as therapeutic agents, with the aim to provide further insights into the development of inhibitors targeting this pathway for the treatment of NDD."

It is caused by a GAA repeat expansion mutation within the frataxin gene (FXN). This impedes FXN transcription resulting in a progressive decrease of the mitochondrial protein, frataxin. Increased oxidative stress leading to a chronic depletion of endogenous antioxidants affects the survival of the cells and causes neurodegeneration. In particular, cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) show a significant increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and lower level of reduced glutathione (GSH). In FRDA, one of the major pathways of oxidant scavengers, the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, is defective. Previous studies on FRDA-like CGNs showed that the reduced level of frataxin and the oxidative stress induce mitochondrial impairments. By triggering the Nrf2 endogenous pathway pharmacologically we determined whether this could promote mitochondrial fitness and counteract oxidative stress. In this work, we sought to investigate the beneficial effect of a promising Nrf2-inducer, omaveloxolone (omav), in CGNs from two FRDA mouse models, KIKO and YG8R, and human fibroblasts from patients. We found that CGNs from both KIKO and YG8R presented Complex I deficiency and that omav was able to restore substrate availability and Complex I activity. This was also confirmed in human primary fibroblasts from FRDA patients. Although fibroblasts are not the major tissue affected, we found that they show significant differences recapitulating the disease; this is therefore an important tool to investigate patients' pathophysiology. Interestingly, we found that patient fibroblasts had an increased level of endogenous lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial ROS (mROS), and lower GSH at rest. Omav was able to reverse this phenotype, protecting the cells against oxidative stress. By stimulating the cells with hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and looking for potential mitochondrial pathophysiology, we found that fibroblasts could not maintain their mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8<sub>m</sub>). Remarkably, omav was protective to mitochondrial depolarization, promoting mitochondrial respiration and preventing cell death. Our results show that omav promotes Complex I activity and protect cells from oxidative stress. Omav could, therefore, be used as a novel therapeutic drug to ameliorate the pathophysiology of FRDA."

In Tyrosinemia type 1 (TYRSN1) mutations affect fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, leading to accumulation of toxic intermediates of tyrosine catabolism. Treatment of TYRSN1 with nitisinone results in extreme tissue levels of tyrosine. Although PKU and TYRSN1 have opposite effects on tyrosine levels, both conditions have been associated with neuro-psychiatric symptoms typically present in ADHD, possibly indicating an impaired dopamine (DA) synthesis. However, concrete in vivo data on the possible molecular basis for disrupted DA production under disease mimicking conditions have been lacking. In pursuit to uncover associated molecular mechanisms, we exposed an established, DA producing cell line (PC12) to different concentrations of phenylalanine and tyrosine in culture media. We measured the effects on viability, proteomic composition, tyrosine, DA and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels and TH phosphorylation. TH catalyzes the rate-limiting step in DA synthesis. High extracellular levels of phenylalanine depleted cells of intracellular tyrosine and DA. Compared to physiological levels (75\u00a0\u03bcM), either low (35\u00a0\u03bcM) or high concentrations of tyrosine (275 or 835\u00a0\u03bcM) decreased cellular DA, TH protein, and its phosphorylation levels. Using deep proteomic analysis, we identified multiple proteins, biological processes and pathways that were altered, including enzymes and transporters involved in amino acid metabolism. Using this information and published data, we developed a mathematical model to predict how extracellular levels of aromatic amino acids can affect the cellular synthesis of DA via different mechanisms. Together, these data provide new information about the normal regulation of neurotransmitter synthesis and how this may be altered in neurometabolic disorders, such as PKU and TYRSN1, with implications for the treatment of cognitive symptoms resulting from comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders."

To date there have been no reports on the molecular analysis of PKU in Iranian population. In this study, the states of the PKU disease in terms of prevalence and mutation spectrum among patients reside in the institutions for mentally retarded in Isfahan was investigated. In the first step, 611 out of 1541 patients with PKU phenotype or severe mental retardation were screened for the PKU disease using the Guthrie bacterial inhibition assay (GBIA) followed by HPLC. Among the patients screened 34 (5.56%) were found positive with abnormal serum Phe of above 7mg/dl. In the next step, the presence of 18 common mutations of the PAH gene in 26 of the patients with classical PKU (serum Phe above 20mg/dl) was investigated, using the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Of the 52 independent mutant alleles that were analyzed, 34 (65.38%) were genotyped showing 8 mutations as follows: R252W (15.38%), Q232Q (13.46%), R261Q (7.69%), delL364 (7.69%), IVS10-11g>a (5.77%), L333F (5.77%), V245V (5.77%) and S67P (3.85%).

At present, T lymphocyte-directed gene therapy is the only means for which a safety record has been established. Thus, we investigated the applicability of this strategy to PKU gene therapy. We first looked for tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) activity, which are required for the phenylalanine hydroxylation reaction and BH4 regeneration, respectively, in T cells isolated from PKU children. We found that T cells contained a small amount of biopterin, but significant DHPR activity, and that the intracellular biopterin content could be increased by exogenous BH4 supplementation. Moreover, PKU T cells were capable of taking up phenylalanine efficiently and effluxing acquired tyrosine. Finally, a recombinant retrovirus containing the human PAH cDNA was constructed and used to transduce isolated PKU T cells. Viral-transduced T cells produced high levels of PAH activity as compared to control mock-infected T cells. These results indicate that T lymphocytes express all that is required for synthesizing/replenishing constituents of the phenylalanine hydroxylation reaction and expressing transduced phenylalanine hydroxylase cDNA."

PKU, an autosomal recessive disease, is an inborn error of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism caused by pathogenic variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. The prevalence of PKU varies widely among ethnicities and geographic regions, affecting approximately 1 in 24,000 individuals worldwide. Deficiency in the PAH enzyme or, in rare cases, the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin results in high blood Phe concentrations, causing brain dysfunction. Untreated PKU, also known as PAH deficiency, results in severe and irreversible intellectual disability, epilepsy, behavioral disorders, and clinical features such as acquired microcephaly, seizures, psychological signs, and generalized hypopigmentation of skin (including hair and eyes). Severe phenotypes are classic PKU, and less severe forms of PAH deficiency are moderate PKU, mild PKU, mild hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA), or benign HPA. Early diagnosis and intervention must start shortly after birth to prevent major cognitive and neurological effects. Dietary treatment, including natural protein restriction and Phe-free supplements, must be used to maintain blood Phe concentrations of 120-360\u00a0\u03bcmol/L throughout the life span. Additional treatments include the casein glycomacropeptide (GMP), which contains very limited aromatic amino acids and may improve immunological function, and large neutral amino acid (LNAA) supplementation to prevent plasma Phe transport into the brain. The synthetic BH4 analog, sapropterin hydrochloride (i.e., Kuvan\u00ae, BioMarin), is another potential treatment that activates residual PAH, thus decreasing Phe concentrations in the blood of PKU patients. Moreover, daily subcutaneous injection of pegylated Phe ammonia-lyase (i.e., pegvaliase; PALYNZIQ\u00ae, BioMarin) has promised gene therapy in recent clinical trials, and mRNA approaches are also being studied."

To date there have been no reports on the molecular analysis of phenylketonuria in the Iranian Azeri Turkish population. In this study, a total of 88 independent alleles from this ethnic group were investigated.\nRESULTS: Thirteen different mutations have been detected, which account for 75% of the total mutant alleles. Two mutations were found at high frequencies: IVS10-11G>A (19.3%) and P281L (19.3%), possibly due to consanguinity and genetic drift, among other factors. The frequencies of the other mutations were c.590_612del (5.7%), R261Q (5.7%), R261X (4.5%), R243X (4.5%), IVS2+5G>C (3.4%), IVS4+1G>A (3.4%), R158Q (2.3%), E280K (2.3%), G247D (2.3%), IVS11+1G>C (1.1%), and R270K (1.1%).\nCONCLUSIONS: These intriguing preliminary findings confirm IVS10-11G>A as a major mutation among Mediterranean mutations. For this population, exons 7 and 11 and adjacent introns, which carry more than 75% of the mutations, would have to be primarily screened. However, the other exons must be studied when either one or no mutations are found in the primary screening. The mutation spectrum in the patients with Azeri Turkish ethnic origin differed from that observed in patients from other Mediterranean countries and further defined the molecular heterogeneity of this disease."

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic defect in phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism. Offspring of phenylketonuric mothers not under strict dietary control are born with maternal PKU (mPKU), a syndrome with similar characteristics as FAS and FSS. While ethanol has been shown to cause neuronal death, no such evidence is available for toluene or Phe and/or its metabolites. On the other hand, alterations in astrocyte proliferation and maturation have been found, mostly in in vitro studies, which may represent a potential common mode of action for at least some of the CNS effects found in FAS, mPKU, and FSS. Further in vivo and in vitro studies should validate this hypothesis and elucidate possible molecular targets."

It is an autosomal recessive disorder with a rate of incidence of 1 in 10,000 in Caucasian populations. Mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene are the major cause of PKU, due to the loss of the catalytic activity of the enzyme product PAH. Newborn screening for PKU allows early intervention, avoiding irreparable neurological damage and intellectual disability that would arise from untreated PKU. The current primary treatment of PKU is the limitation of dietary protein intake, which in the long term may be associated with poor compliance in some cases and other health problems due to malnutrition. The only alternative therapy currently approved is the supplementation of BH4, the requisite co-factor of PAH, in the orally-available form of sapropterin dihydrochloride. This treatment is not universally available, and is only effective for a proportion (estimated 30%) of PKU patients. Research into novel therapies for PKU has taken many different approaches to address the lack of PAH activity at the core of this disorder: enzyme replacement via virus-mediated gene transfer, transplantation of donor liver and recombinant PAH protein, enzyme substitution using phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) to provide an alternative pathway for the metabolism of phenylalanine, and restoration of native PAH activity using chemical chaperones and nonsense read-through agents. It is hoped that continuing efforts into these studies will translate into a significant improvement in the physical outcome, as well as quality of life, for patients with PKU."

The lack of treatment can cause neurological and cognitive impairment, as severe mental retardation, neuronal cell loss and synaptic density reduction.

We found decreased Phe levels and increased L-car concentrations in PKU patients treated with L-car compared to the other groups, indicating that the proposed treatment was effective. Furthermore, we found increased BDNF levels in the patients under treatment compared to patients at early diagnosis, and a positive correlation between BDNF and L-car and a negative correlation between BDNF and Phe. Our results may indicate that in PKU patients treated with L-car there is an attempt to adjust neuronal plasticity and recover the damage suffered, reflecting a compensatory response to brain injury."

Among aminoacidopathies, PKU is one of the most prevalent disorders in different populations. It may be caused by deficiency of BH4 or mutations in PAH. About 98% of PKU patients have mutations in the PAH, while the remaining have BH4 deficiency. If PKU is diagnosed earlier in life using advance analytical techniques (e.g., high performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and polymerase chain reaction), then it is potentially treatable by special diets (L-phenylalanine-free medical formula). However, some complications such as vitamin B12 deficiency, cardiovascular problems, and neurodevelopmental problems have been reported in PKU patients when they ate special diets for a long period. Hence, special diet alone is not a good option for proper treatment. Next generation therapies require structure-function based development. For therapies which target PAH gene (e.g., gene therapy, RNAi, gene editing), a lot of research has yet to be done. Treatment with BH4 therapy is safe and effective but only in BH4-responsive PKU patients. Therefore, research efforts should be focused on the development of more targeted pharmacological and genetic therapies especially PAH gene therapy, which can reduce the burden or deleterious effects of this disease in affected patients."

After many years of experience treating PKU, new challenges have emerged. It has become apparent that defective activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase leads to a spectrum of clinical presentations that has led to subclassifications of PKU. Blood phenylalanine greater than 1200 mumol/L usually indicates severe deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase and is often called \"classical PKU.\" Blood phenylalanine levels between 600 and 1200 mumol/L lead to \"atypical PKU.\" Cases where blood phenylalanine remains between 120 and 480 mumol/L on a normal diet are termed \"benign hyperphenylalaninemia.\" A deficiency of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which is required for phenylalanine hydroxylase activity, leads to hyperphenylalaninemia. This cofactor is also required for the enzymatic hydroxylation of tyrosine and tryptophan. Cofactor defects account for only 1-3% of hyperphenylalaninemia, which has been termed \"malignant PKU\", but they must be identified so that appropriate treatment can be established. Long-term treatment of PKU is currently advised because loss of IQ, poor school performance, and behavior problems occur when blood phenylalanine levels increase. Therefore, there is reason to continue the diet as patients become older. When blood phenylalanine levels are elevated during pregnancy a \"maternal PKU syndrome\" may result. Babies born to untreated mothers with PKU are at risk for being small for gestational age with microcephaly, mental retardation and congenital heart defects. A national collaborative study for the treatment of maternal PKU is underway. The characterization of the gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase has added a new exciting chapter to the study of PKU.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

A pilot study was undertaken to examine the response to 6-R-l-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) in patients with atypical and classical PKU.\nMETHODS: PAH gene mutation analysis was performed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and gene sequencing. Patients with classical, atypical, or mild PKU were orally given BH4 10 mg/kg. Blood phenylalanine and tyrosine levels were determined using tandem MS/MS at 0 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours intervals.\nRESULTS: Thirty-six patients were given a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg of BH4. Twenty one patients (58.33%) responded with a decrease in blood phenylalanine level. Of the patients that responded, 12 were classical, 7 atypical, and 2 mild. The mean decline in blood phenylalanine at 24 hours was > 30% of baseline. There were 15 patients who did not respond to the BH4 challenge, 14 of those had classical and one had atypical PKU. Mapping the mutations that responded to BH4 on the PAH enzyme showed that mutations were in the catalytic, regulatory, oligomerization, and BH4 binding domains. Five patients responding to BH4 had mutations not previously identified.\nCONCLUSION: The data presented suggest higher than anticipated number of PKU mutations respond to BH4, and such mutations are on all the domains of PAH."

This study aimed to reveal the impacts of these variants on the structural stability of the PAH enzyme. In-silico analyses using prediction tools and molecular dynamics simulations were performed. Mutations were introduced to the wild type catalytic monomer and full length tetramer crystal structures. Variant pathogenicity analyses predicted p.Y198N to be damaging, and p.Y204F to be benign by some prediction tools and damaging by others. Simulations suggested p.Y198N mutation cause significant fluctuations in the spatial organization of two catalytic residues in the temperature accelerated MD simulations with the monomer and increased root-mean-square deviations in the tetramer structure. p.Y204F causes noticeable changes in the spatial positioning of T278 suggesting a possible segregation from the catalytic site in temperature accelerated MD simulations with the monomer. This mutation also leads to increased root-mean-square fluctuations in the regulatory domain which may lead to conformational change resulting in inhibition of dimerization and enzyme activation. Our study reports two novel mutations in the PAH gene and gives insight to their effects on the PAH activity.

Although there is statistically significant disequilibrium between STR alleles and RFLP-based haplotypes, there is a relatively low degree of disequilibrium between STR alleles and certain RFLP sites.

This study sets out to analyze the screening results of children with phenylketonuria (PKU) in Yinchuan City and characterize the mutation variants of the PAH gene.\nMETHODS: Phenylketonuria screening results were retrospectively analyzed in 398,605 neonates (207,361 males and 191,244 females) born in different maternity hospitals in Yinchuan City between January 2017 and December 2021. Screening for genetic metabolic diseases was performed with parental consent at their own expense. A comprehensive diagnosis was performed by integrating tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) findings with clinical presentations. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) was used to detect genetic and metabolic disease-associated genes in children with PKU who were clinically diagnosed and voluntarily tested. The identified loci were validated through Sanger sequencing and parental verification.\nRESULTS: Among the screened newborns, 45 (11.3/100,000) PKU cases were diagnosed. In the 38 cases that underwent self-financed PAH sequencing, 56 mutations were detected in 76 chromosomes, with an overall detection rate of 73.7%. All patients harbored mutant genes, and the 56 mutations detected identified represented 14 variants, including 8 missense mutations, 2 splicing mutations, 2 nonsense mutations, and 2 silent mutations. The mutations were primarily distributed in exons 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, and intron 4, with the highest frequency observed in exon 7 (25 [44.7%]), followed by exon 11 (15 [26.7%]).

The purpose of this study was to capture real-world data associated with managing PKU under current standard of care and to characterize a representative population for a planned gene therapy trial.\nMETHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted at two U.S. clinics for individuals 10-40\u00a0years old diagnosed with PKU-related hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA). Demographics, medical history, treatments and blood Phe data were collected from electronic medical records spanning a five-year period ending in November 2017.\nRESULTS: 152 patients were enrolled (65.8% had classical PKU). Although >95% of patients were prescribed a Phe-restricted diet, blood Phe concentrations remained substantially elevated, particularly in patients diagnosed with classical PKU. As the Phe threshold was lowered (Phe\u00a0<\u00a0600, 360, 120 or 30\u00a0\u03bcmol/L), the number of patients with consecutive lab values below the threshold decreased, suggesting that many patients' Phe levels are inadequately controlled. 62.5% of patients were reported as having a history of at least one neuropsychiatric comorbidity, and adults were more likely than adolescents (69.5% vs. 54.3%). 92 of 98 PAH genotypes collected were distinct mutations; the 6 null-null genotypes were associated with classical PKU. Overall the demographics and clinical data were consistent across both sites.\nCONCLUSION: Despite dietary restrictions, mean Phe concentrations were\u00a0>\u00a0360\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (a level considered well-controlled based on current U.S. treatment guidelines) for mild, moderate, and classical PKU patients. There remains an unmet need for therapies to control Phe concentrations."

To define the molecular basis of PKU, we characterized twelve restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotypes of the PAH locus in the northern European population and observed that 90% of the PKU alleles in this population are confined to four common RFLP haplotypes. We have recently reported a splicing mutation in the PAH gene that is associated with RFLP haplotype 3 which is present at about 40% of mutant alleles. We now report the molecular lesion associated with the RFLP haplotype 2 mutant allele. This defect is caused by a C-to-T transition in exon 12 resulting in an amino-acid substitution (Arg to Trp) at residue 408 of PAH. Direct hybridization analysis of the point mutation using a specific oligonucleotide probe demonstrated that this mutation is also in linkage disequilibrium with RFLP haplotype 2 alleles that make up about 20% of mutant PAH genes."

PKU is caused by autosomal recessive mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) and manifests with elevation of phenylalanine (Phe) in plasma and urine. Untreated PKU manifests with intellectual disability including seizures, microcephaly and behavioral abnormalities. Early treatment and good compliance result in a normal intellectual outcome in many but not in all patients. This study examined plasma metabolites in patients with PKU (n = 27), hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA, n = 1) and healthy controls (n = 32) by LC- MS/MS. We hypothesized that PKU patients would exhibit a distinct \"submetabolome\" compared to that of healthy controls. We further hypothesized that the submetabolome of PKU patients with good metabolic control would resemble that of healthy controls. Results from this study show: (i) Distinct clustering of healthy controls and PKU patients based on polar metabolite profiling, (ii) Increased and decreased concentrations of metabolites within and afar from the Phe pathway in treated patients, and (iii) A specific PKU-submetabolome independently of metabolic control assessed by Phe in plasma. We examined the relationship between PKU metabolic control and extended metabolite profiles in plasma. The PKU submetabolome characterized in this study represents the combined effects of dietary adherence, adjustments in metabolic pathways to compensate for defective Phe processing, as well as metabolic derangements that could not be corrected with dietary management even in patients classified as having good metabolic control. New therapeutic targets may be uncovered to approximate the PKU submetabolome to that of healthy controls and prevent long-term organ damage."

To test this hypothesis, we performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for the identification of uncharacterized mutant alleles after PAH sequence analysis of 33 unrelated Korean patients with PKU. Bi-directional sequencing of the PAH exons and flanking intronic regions revealed 27 different mutations, including four novel mutations (two missense and two deletion mutations), comprising 57/66 (86%) mutant alleles. MLPA identified a large deletion that encompassed exons 5 and 6 in four patients, another large deletion that extended from exon 4 to exon 7 in one patient, and a duplication of exon 4 in one patient.

Here, we present a unique approach to treating PKU deficiency by using an mRNA replacement therapy.

Animals carrying this missense mutation develop hyperphenylalanemia and hypotyrosinemia in plasma, two clinical features commonly observed in the clinical presentation of PKU. We show that intravenous infusion of LUNAR-hPAH mRNA can generate high levels of hPAH protein in hepatocytes and restore the Phe metabolism in the Pah enu2 mouse model.

These disorders can be prevented if a diet low in phe is introduced. This report focuses on a preterm newborn (gestational age 29 wk) with adequate weight (1290 g) and no family history of PKU. His parents had not received metabolic neonatal screening. A blood sample at 16 d of age and a weight of 1430\u00a0g showed phe 420 \u03bcmol/L, compatible with mild PKU. Mixed feeding was initiated with a formula free of phe (X-Phe), and breastfeeding was fortified with a contribution of 3.5\u00a0g/kg daily (2.5\u00a0g X-Phe and 1\u00a0g of high-value biological proteins). The next measurements of amino acid levels in the blood and urine were normal, and the progenitors study for PKU was negative. Normal feeding was reintroduced with normal neurologic and metabolic later evolution. The disorders of the metabolism of phe, in most cases, are due to a genetic condition. However, there are infrequent cases of transient hyperphenylalaninemia secondary to delayed maturation of the hydroxylation enzyme system. They are especially significant in premature infants. Although these forms have not been shown to cause sequelae, in view of high levels of phe in the blood, phe consumption must be restricted."

Toxic accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites, left untreated, affects brain development and function depending on the timing of exposure to elevated levels. The specific mechanisms of Phe-induced brain damage are not completely understood, but they correlate to phenylalanine levels and on the stage of brain growth. During fetal life, high levels of phenylalanine such as those seen in maternal PKU can result in microcephaly, neuronal loss and corpus callosum hypoplasia. Elevated phenylalanine levels during the first few years of life can cause acquired microcephaly, severe cognitive impairment and epilepsy, likely due to the impairment of synaptogenesis. During late childhood, elevated phenylalanine can cause alterations in neurological functioning, leading to ADHD, speech delay and mild IQ reduction. In adolescents and adults, executive function and mood are affected, with some of the abnormalities reversed by better control of phenylalanine levels. Altered brain myelination can be present at this stage.

Previously reported but uncharacterized PAH gene mutation, p.S231F (c.692C > T), was detected in Serbian patients with classical PKU. We analyzed p.S231F PAH protein in prokaryotic (Escherichia coli) and eukaryotic expression system (hepatoma cells). In both systems the mutant enzyme was unstable. Residual enzyme activity in vitro was approximately 1%. Mutation p.S231F PAH was not activated by pre-incubation with phenylalanine substrate. We found no GroEL/GroES chaperone effect and slightly positive effect of the (6R)-L-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)) on the stabilization of the protein structure. Our findings were in accordance with severe patients' phenotypes. In conclusion, p.S231F should be classified as a functionally null PAH gene mutation as it drastically reduces stability and activity of the PAH enzyme in vitro."

Following our first report in 2003, here we presented a comprehensive study on the mutation spectrum of the PAH gene in the Iranian population. This study was performed on 280 unrelated chromosomes from 140 Iranian patients with classic PKU. All 13 exons as well as exon-intron boundaries of the PAH gene were analyzed by direct DNA sequencing. Thirty four different mutations were identified by a mutation detection rate of 100%. IVS10-11G\u00a0>\u00a0A, p.P281L, R261Q, p.F39del and IVS11+1G\u00a0>\u00a0C were the most prevalent mutations with frequencies of 26.07%, 19.3%, 12.86%, 6.07 and 3.93%, respectively.

Of the 27 families, disease-causing mutations were detected in 25. A total of 20 different mutations were identified of which 7 \"unique\" mutations accounted for 13 of 25 mutation positive families. The unique mutations detected exclusively in Indian PKU patients included three recurrent mutations detected in three families each. The 20 mutations included only 5 missense mutations in addition to 5 splice, 4 each nonsense and insertion-deletion mutations, a silent variant in coding region and a 3'UTR mutation. One deletion and two nonsense mutations were characterized to confirm significant reduction in mutant transcript levels possibly through activation of nonsense mediated decay. All missense mutations affected conserved amino acid residues and sequence and structure analysis suggested significant perturbations in the enzyme activity of respective mutant proteins. This is probably the first report of identification of a significantly low proportion of missense PAH mutations from PKU families and together with the presence of a high proportion of splice, insertion-deletion, and nonsense mutations, points to a unique PAH mutation profile in Indian PKU patients."

Two major PKU mutations, R413P and IVS4nt-1, may have originated in different populations, spreading in prehistoric times through the Asian continent due to the founder effect, genetic drift, and bottleneck effect. We found different mutations in Caucasians and East Asians, thus PKU mutations have occurred after ethnic divergence between Caucasians and East Asians. Furthermore, PKU genotype and in vitro PAH activity in expression analysis correlates to the clinical and biochemical phenotypes in East Asians.

If untreated, this brain dysfunction results in severe intellectual disability, epilepsy and behavioural problems. The prevalence varies worldwide, with an average of about 1:10,000 newborns. Early diagnosis is based on newborn screening, and if treatment is started early and continued, intelligence is within normal limits with, on average, some suboptimal neurocognitive function. Dietary restriction of phenylalanine has been the mainstay of treatment for over 60 years and has been highly successful, although outcomes are still suboptimal and patients can find the treatment difficult to adhere to. Pharmacological treatments are available, such as tetrahydrobiopterin, which is effective in only a minority of patients (usually those with milder PKU), and pegylated phenylalanine ammonia lyase, which requires daily subcutaneous injections and causes adverse immune responses. Given the drawbacks of these approaches, other treatments are in development, such as mRNA and gene therapy. Even though PAH deficiency is the most common defect of amino acid metabolism in humans, brain dysfunction in individuals with PKU is still not well understood and further research is needed to facilitate development of pathophysiology-driven treatments."

EDS causes a myriad of symptoms, including skin hyperextensibility and fragility, easy bruising and bleeding, joint hypermobility, subluxation, dislocation, and chronic pain. Pain is one of the most common symptoms of EDS, leading to disability and decreased quality of life. Current guidelines for treating chronic pain in EDS are lacking. Clinicians focus on a conservative multidisciplinary approach in patients with EDS, which avoids surgical interventions and its accompanying risks of morbidity and mortality. The multidisciplinary approach includes physiotherapy, occupational therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and pharmacologic interventions to decrease pain. This review identifies literature examining the components of this conservative multidisciplinary approach and their effectiveness across the PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Trip databases, using the terms \"Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome AND Pain Management\" that was then subsequently evaluated. The evaluation of this current literature provides weak evidence to support the efficacy of the individual components of the conservative multidisciplinary approach. Lack of alternative approaches leaves medical providers with little choice but to suggest these pain control methods, despite low-grade evidence of weak evidence of their efficacy. More research into the pathophysiology of chronic pain in EDS could help identify additional modes and rationales for therapy."

Studies on treatment modalities are few and insufficient to guide management. The following is a discussion of the evidence regarding the underlying mechanisms of pain in EDS. The causes of pain in this condition are multifactorial and include joint subluxations and dislocations, previous surgery, muscle weakness, proprioceptive disorders, and vertebral instability. Affected persons may also present with generalized body pain, fatigue, headaches, gastrointestinal pain, temporomandibular joint pain, dysmenorrhea, and vulvodynia. Pain management strategies may be focused around treating the cause of the pain (e.g., dislocation of a joint, proprioceptive disorder) and minimizing the sensation of pain.

Patients with EDS are prone for chronic myofascial pain, apart from other comorbidities. Although the initial pathology is commonly nociceptive, progression of EDS leads to neuropathies and central sensitization of pain signals. Overall, approximately 90% or more EDS patients suffer from chronic pain. There are no existing guidelines to manage chronic pain in EDS patients. In this article, we illustrate 2 case reports of EDS patients with chronic pain and review the relevant literature regarding the pathological considerations and management of chronic pain in EDS.\nPATIENT CONCERNS: Our first patient had worsening multiple joint pains despite treatment with medications and a recent diagnosis of EDS-type 3. The second patient had a complicated history including longstanding EDS and multiple previous surgeries. She was referred due to concern about complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) in her upper extremity.\nDIAGNOSES: For the first patient, apart from chronic pain due to her EDS, her history also revealed that she suffered from kinesiophobia. For the second patient, a detailed clinical assessment revealed no signs of CRPS but instead a generalized worsening of EDS symptoms.\nINTERVENTIONS: Both patients were evaluated by the multidisciplinary team consisting of a pain physician, nurse, pain psychologist, and a kinesiologist. Their treatment involved optimization of daily medications, participation in pain self-management sessions that included cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercises, coping, and relaxation strategies.\nOUTCOMES: Both patients demonstrated significantly better pain control and achieved overall improvement in daily living.\nLESSONS: EDS is a complex illness with a multitude of symptoms. As in our patients, EDS patients also suffer from panic and anxiety disorders that increase the burden of pain. Apart from optimization of medications, EDS patients are best managed by a multidisciplinary approach that includes pain education and life style changes. The caution that they are resistant to local anesthetics is unwarranted. Appropriate pain interventions in selected patients may have a role to decrease pain intensity."

We report a 23-year-old male with history of Type-IV Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome who presented with severe abdominal pain and tachycardia following an episode of vomiting. Further work-up of his abdominal pain revealed massive retroperitoneal bleeding by CT-scan of the abdomen. Given numerous cases of catastrophic injury caused by surgical intervention in Type-IV Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, the patient was treated non-operatively, and the patient made a full recovery. This case suggests that even in cases of large retroperitoneal hemorrhages associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, it may not truly represent a surgical emergency."

Recently, a new EDS subtype, i.e., classical-like EDS type 2, was defined after the identification, in six patients with clinical findings reminiscent of EDS, of recessive alterations in AEBP1, which encodes the aortic carboxypeptidase\u207blike protein associating with collagens in the extracellular matrix. Herein, we report on a 53-year-old patient, born from healthy second-cousins, who fitted the diagnostic criteria for classical EDS (cEDS) for the presence of hyperextensible skin with multiple atrophic scars, generalized joint hypermobility, and other minor criteria. Molecular analyses of cEDS genes did not identify any causal variant. Therefore, AEBP1 sequencing was performed that revealed homozygosity for the rare c.1925T&gt;C p.(Leu642Pro) variant classified as likely pathogenetic (class 4) according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. The comparison of the patient's features with those of the other patients reported up to now and the identification of the first missense variant likely associated with the condition offer future perspectives for EDS nosology and research in this field."

These types are caused by variants in 20 different genes, the majority of which encode the fibrillar collagen types I, III and V, modifying or processing enzymes for those proteins, and enzymes that can modify glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans.

This can make these disorders particularly challenging to diagnose and manage.

One of the subtypes of EDS, classical (cEDS), is characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility and atrophic scars, which are major criteria of cEDS.\nAIM: In this study, the first in Central Eastern Europe, 44 patients were investigated. All of them were tested for COL5A1 mutations with direct DNA sequencing.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group included 44 patients of Polish origin, all of whom fulfilled criteria for the classical type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Direct sequencing of the COL5A1, COL5A2 and COL1A1 c.934C&gt;T genes was performed for all of them. Evaluation of potential pathogenicity of detected missense mutation was conducted using SIFT (Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant), PolyPhen-2, AlignGVGD (Align Grantham Variance/Grantham Difference). The effect of the splice site mutations was predicted by Human Splicing Finder and NetGene2 tools.\nRESULTS: Among all tested patients, nine mutations of COL5A1 gene were detected (8 missense mutations and 1 splice site). The alterations identified by us are new, hitherto not described in other reports. Evaluation of the mutations by in silico tools indicate their pathogenicity.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first COL5A1 gene molecular investigation conducted among cEDS patients from Central Eastern Europe. Besides new COL5A1 variant findings, we gained molecular confirmation of clinical diagnosis of cEDS. In some cases, specific and adequate evaluation and classification of EDS patients based only on clinical features, may be difficult."

For each of the subtypes, we propose a set of clinical criteria that are suggestive for the diagnosis. However, in view of the vast genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic variability of the EDS subtypes, and the clinical overlap between EDS subtypes, but also with other HCTDs, the definite diagnosis of all EDS subtypes, except for the hypermobile type, relies on molecular confirmation with identification of (a) causative genetic variant(s). We also revised the clinical criteria for hypermobile EDS in order to allow for a better distinction from other joint hypermobility disorders. To satisfy research needs, we also propose a pathogenetic scheme, that regroups EDS subtypes for which the causative proteins function within the same pathway. We hope that the revised International EDS Classification will serve as a new standard for the diagnosis of EDS and will provide a framework for future research purposes. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

How this hereditary connective tissue disorder causes pain remains unclear although previous studies suggested it shares similar mechanisms with neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia.\nMETHODS: In this prospective study seeking information on the mechanisms underlying pain in patients with JHS/EDS-HT, we enrolled 27 consecutive patients with this connective tissue disorder. Patients underwent a detailed clinical examination, including the neuropathic pain questionnaire DN4 and the fibromyalgia rapid screening tool. As quantitative sensory testing methods, we included thermal-pain perceptive thresholds and the wind-up ratio and recorded a standard nerve conduction study to assess non-nociceptive fibres and laser-evoked potentials, assessing nociceptive fibres.\nRESULTS: Clinical examination and diagnostic tests disclosed no somatosensory nervous system damage. Conversely, most patients suffered from widespread pain, the fibromyalgia rapid screening tool elicited positive findings, and quantitative sensory testing showed lowered cold and heat pain thresholds and an increased wind-up ratio.\nCONCLUSIONS: While the lack of somatosensory nervous system damage is incompatible with neuropathic pain as the mechanism underlying pain in JHS/EDS-HT, the lowered cold and heat pain thresholds and increased wind-up ratio imply that pain in JHS/EDS-HT might arise through central sensitization. Hence, this connective tissue disorder and fibromyalgia share similar pain mechanisms. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD?: In patients with JHS/EDS-HT, the persistent nociceptive input due to joint abnormalities probably triggers central sensitization in the dorsal horn neurons and causes widespread pain."

Currently, musculoskeletal manifestations related to joint hypermobility are perceived as the most prevalent determinants of the quality of life of affected individuals. The 2017 International Classification of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and related disorders identifies 13 clinical types due to deleterious variants in 19 different genes. Recent publications point out the possibility of a wider spectrum of conditions that may be considered members of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome community. Most Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are due to inherited abnormalities affecting the biogenesis of fibrillar collagens and other components of the extracellular matrix. The introduction of next-generation sequencing technologies in the diagnostic setting fastened patients' classification and improved our knowledge on the phenotypic variability of many Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. This is impacting significantly patients' management and family counseling. At the same time, most individuals presenting with joint hypermobility and associated musculoskeletal manifestations still remain without a firm diagnosis, due to a too vague clinical presentation and/or the lack of an identifiable molecular biomarker. These individuals are currently defined with the term \"hypermobility spectrum disorders\". Hence, in parallel with a continuous update of the International Classification of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, the scientific community is investing efforts in offering a more efficient framework for classifying and, hopefully, managing individuals with joint hypermobility."

Mutations in the type V collagen genes account for up to 50 percent of cases of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but many other cases are unexplained. We investigated whether the deficiency of the tenascins, extracellular-matrix proteins that are highly expressed in connective tissues, was associated with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\nMETHODS: We screened serum samples from 151 patients with the classic, hypermobility, or vascular types of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; 75 patients with psoriasis; 93 patients with rheumatoid arthritis; and 21 healthy persons for the presence of tenascin-X and tenascin-C by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We examined the expression of tenascins and type V collagen in skin by immunohistochemical methods and sequenced the tenascin-X gene.\nRESULTS: Tenascin-X was present in serum from all normal subjects, all patients with psoriasis, all patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and 146 of 151 patients with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Tenascin-X was absent from the serum of the 5 remaining patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, who were unrelated. Tenascin-X deficiency was confirmed in these patients by analysis of skin fibroblasts and by immunostaining of skin. The expression of tenascin-C and type V collagen was normal in these patients. All five of these patients had hypermobile joints, hyperelastic skin, and easy bruising, without atrophic scarring. Tenascin-X mutations were identified in all tenascin-X-deficient patients; one patient had a homozygous tenascin-X gene deletion, one was heterozygous for the deletion, and three others had homozygous truncating point mutations, confirming a causative role for tenascin-X and a recessive pattern of inheritance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Tenascin-X deficiency causes a clinically distinct, recessive form of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This finding indicates that factors other than the collagens or collagen-processing enzymes can cause the syndrome and suggests a central role for tenascin-X in maintaining the integrity of collagenous matrix."

For the more prevalent hypermobile and classic EDS types, some case-control studies found mildly decreased bone mineral density, but it was not clear that fracture rates were increased. Nevertheless, abnormalities in vertebral shape seem to be common in classical and hypermobile EDS types. In a cohort of individuals with EDS followed since birth, no fractures were observed during infancy. Bone mineral density varies widely among the different types of EDS, and vertebral abnormalities seem to be common in classical and hypermobile EDS. It might be justified to perform spine radiographs and bone mineral density assessments in newly diagnosed EDS."

It is currently estimated that approximately 50% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harbor mutations in the COL5A1 and the COL5A2 gene, encoding the \u03b11 and the \u03b12-chain of type V collagen, respectively. However, because no prospective molecular studies of COL5A1 and COL5A2 have been performed in a clinically well-defined patient group, this number may underestimate the real proportion of patients with classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harboring a mutation in one of these genes. In the majority of patients with molecularly characterized classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the disease is caused by a mutation leading to a nonfunctional COL5A1 allele and resulting in haploinsufficiency of type V collagen. A smaller proportion of patients harbor a structural mutation in COL5A1 or COL5A2, causing the production of a functionally defective type V collagen protein. Most mutations identified so far result in a reduced amount of type V collagen in the connective tissues available for collagen fibrillogenesis. Inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variability is observed, but no genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed.

We describe the 11th patient (9th family) with clEDS2, who was complicated by a critical vascular event (superior mesenteric artery aneurysm and rupture). A next-generation sequencing panel-based analysis revealed compound heterozygous variants in AEBP1: NM_001129.5:c.[2296G&gt;T]; [2383dup], p.[(Glu766*)]; [(Glu795Glyfs*3)]. Light microscopic analyses showed increased interfibrillar spaces in the reticular dermis, a disorganized arrangement of collagen fibers, and decreased collagen content. An electron microscopic analysis showed the presence of collagen fibrils with irregular contours (flower-like appearance) and small collagen fibrils. A biochemical analysis showed reduced secretion of type I and type III procollagen. Clinical and molecular features of the current patient and all previously reported patients were reviewed comprehensively. Manifestations noted in most cases (&gt;80%) included skin features (hyperextensibility, atrophic scars, easy bruising, excessive skin/skin folding, delayed wound healing, translucency, piezogenic papules), skeletal features (generalized joint hypermobility, dislocations/subluxations, pes planus), dental abnormalities, and neuromuscular abnormalities. Critical complications, each occurring in a single case, included superior mesenteric artery multiple aneurysm and rupture, aortic root dilation requiring surgery, and bowel rupture. Most AEBP1 variants were predicted or experimentally confirmed to lead to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, whereas one variant resulted in a protein that was retained intracellularly and not secreted. Clinical, molecular, pathological, and biochemical features of the current patient, as well as a review of all previously reported patients, suggest the importance of the aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein encoded by AEBP1 in collagen fibrillogenesis."

Easy bruising is, to a variable degree, present in all subtypes of EDS. A variable bleeding tendency, manifesting e.g. as gum bleeding, menometrorraghia, postnatal or peri-operative hemorrhage is observed in many EDS-patients of varying EDS subtypes. Life-threatening arterial aneurysms, dissections and ruptures of medium-sized and large arteries are a hallmark of the vascular subtype of EDS, caused by a molecular defect in collagen type III, an important constituent of blood vessel walls and hollow organs. They may however also occur in other EDS subtypes, especially in classical EDS, caused by defects in type V collagen or, rarely, type I collagen, and in kyphoscoliotic EDS, caused by defects in LH1 or FKBP22. These manifestations of vascular fragility and bleeding are usually attributed to fragility of the blood vessel walls and the perivascular connective tissues, but the molecular pathomechanisms underlying these complications are poorly studied. This review summarizes current knowledge on manifestations of vascular fragility in the different EDS subtypes."

The first round allowed us to obtain the most important symptoms to assess according to the patients. The second and third round aimed at ranking the categories according to their order of importance. Establishment of a consensus was evaluated using Kendall's coefficient of concordance.\nRESULTS: A total of 118 responses were analyzed for the first round and 87 for the second and the third round. Ten categories were extracted from the first round. Ranking of the 10 categories in the second round did not reach consensus (W\u2009=\u20090.33, p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001) nor did the four most important categories in the third round (W\u2009=\u20090.43, p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001).

There is currently limited evidence regarding both the global epidemiology of CF and access to this transformative therapy - and therefore where needs are not being met. Therefore, this study aims to define gaps in access to CF treatment.\nMETHODS: Patient data were extracted from established CF registries. Where these were not available, literature searches were conducted alongside an international survey of 51 CF experts to determine the diagnosed patient population. National CF prevalence estimates were combined with registry data on estimated population coverage, to extrapolate the total estimated number of undiagnosed patients. Estimates of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor treatment coverage were extracted from publicly available sales summaries and pricing data.\nRESULTS: 162,428 [144,606-186,620] people are estimated to be living with CF across 94 countries. Of these, an estimated 105,352 (65%) are diagnosed, with 19,516 (12%) receiving triple combination therapy. We estimated 57,076 patients with undiagnosed CF. Owing to a paucity of high-quality data, estimates of undiagnosed CF in low- and middle-income countries are highly uncertain. Patient registries were available in 45 countries, and used to identify 90% of the estimated diagnosed population.\nCONCLUSIONS: A significant CF patient burden exists in countries where disease-modifying drugs are unavailable, and final figures are likely underestimates. This analysis shows the potential to improve rates of diagnosis and treatment for CF, so a higher percentage of patients receive the most effective triple combination treatment."

Over the last decade, the introduction of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator drugs into clinical practice has profoundly modified the lives of many people with CF (PwCF) by targeting the fundamental cause of the disease. These drugs consist of the potentiator ivacaftor (VX-770) and the correctors lumacaftor (VX-809), tezacaftor (VX-661), and elexacaftor (VX-445). In particular, the triple combination of CFTR modulators composed of elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor (ETI) represents a life-changing therapy for the majority of PwCF worldwide. A growing number of clinical studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of ETI therapy in both short- and long-term (up to two years of follow-up to date) and its ability to significantly reduce pulmonary and gastrointestinal manifestations, sweat chloride concentration, exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, and infertility/subfertility, among other disease signs and symptoms. Nevertheless, ETI therapy-related adverse effects have also been reported, and close monitoring by a multidisciplinary healthcare team remains vital. This review aims to address and discuss the major therapeutic benefits and adverse effects reported by the clinical use of ETI therapy for PwCF."

Many countries have instituted CF newborn screening because early diagnosis improves outcome. CF research has greatly intensified following the discovery of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which has more than 2000 different mutations. For patients with common mutations like F508del, CFTR modulators are life transforming and may even prevent major complications if started early in childhood. For some patients with rare CFTR mutations, a treatment path still needs to be developed. Conclusion: This review provides a general update on CF, including screening and current and future treatment."

Clinical presentation of this disease can range from mild manifestations including skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility, to more severe complications such as vascular and organ rupture. While there may be accompanying inflammation in some of the subtypes of EDS, the pathogenic mechanisms have not been clearly defined. Thorough evaluation incorporates clinical examination, family history, laboratory testing, and imaging. In recent years, studies have identified multiple gene variants involved in the pathogenesis of specific EDS subtypes as well as elaborate clinical diagnostic criteria and classification models used to differentiate overlapping conditions. The differential diagnosis of EDS includes hypermobility spectrum disorders, Marfan syndrome, Loey-Dietz syndrome, Cutis laxa syndromes, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, osteogenesis Imperfecta Type 1, fibromyalgia, depression, and chronic fatigue syndrome. Surgical treatment is reserved for complications, or emergencies involving vascular or orthopedic injury because of the risk of poor wound healing. Management techniques each have their own consequences and benefits, which will also be discussed in this review article. Patients affected by this spectrum of disorders are impacted both phenotypically and psychosocially, diminishing their quality of life."

It comprises Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type II, but it is now apparent that these form a continuum of clinical findings and differ only in phenotypic severity. It is currently estimated that approximately 50% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harbor mutations in the COL5A1 and the COL5A2 gene, encoding the \u03b11 and the \u03b12-chain of type V collagen, respectively. However, because no prospective molecular studies of COL5A1 and COL5A2 have been performed in a clinically well-defined patient group, this number may underestimate the real proportion of patients with classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harboring a mutation in one of these genes. In the majority of patients with molecularly characterized classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the disease is caused by a mutation leading to a nonfunctional COL5A1 allele and resulting in haploinsufficiency of type V collagen. A smaller proportion of patients harbor a structural mutation in COL5A1 or COL5A2, causing the production of a functionally defective type V collagen protein. Most mutations identified so far result in a reduced amount of type V collagen in the connective tissues available for collagen fibrillogenesis. Inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variability is observed, but no genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed. No treatment for the underlying defect is presently available for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. However, a series of preventive guidelines are applicable."

The Beighton score is used to confirm or exclude hyperlaxity. While a Beighton score under 5 should not always lead to exclude the diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), a positive scoring of 5 or more (generalized joint hypermobility) is usually required in adults to consider the diagnosis. Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are a group of inherited disorders of connective tissue affecting the biosynthesis and/or structure of collagens or proteoglycans. Various clinical forms have been described. The association of joint hyperlaxity with joint sprain, joint subluxation/dislocation, chronic pain and fatigue may help to distinguish between the hypermobile type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (formely known as Ehlers-Danlos type III) and the joint hypermobility syndrome, although both conditions are sometimes seen as a continuum. The existence of a family history is an additional criteria in favor of the diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, although some cases appear sporadic, likely due to incomplete penetrance and/or variable phenotypic expression. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome do not have any specific etiological treatment. The management is poorly systematized due to the absence of controlled clinical trials or good clinical practice recommendations. Patients should be seen in a department of genetics, physical medicine and rehabilitation or rheumatology to avoid the diagnostic odyssey and help preventing disease complications. Physical rehabilitation and pain management can play a valuable role."

In the course of orthodontic treatment during the last 3 years, severe apical root resorption, gingival recession, and loss of alveolar bone were observed. Family history was noncontributory for any skin or tooth disorders. The typical clinical signs confirmed the diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIII.

In addition to typical EDS characteristics, vEDS patients are at risk of blood vessel rupture due to possession of pathogenic variants of the COL3A1 gene, which encodes type III collagen. Type III collagen is a major component of humans' vascular walls. The management of this disease is possible; however, there is no cure as of present. Recently, discoveries with potential impact on the management of vEDS have been elucidated. Mice with vEDS traits treated with a beta-blocker celiprolol showed significant improvements in their thoracic aorta biomechanical strength. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the specifically designed small interference RNAs (siRNA) can effectively silence the pathogenic variant allele. To enhance the normal allele expression, an intracellularly expressed lysyl oxidase is shown to regulate the transcription rate of the COL3A1 promoter. Similarly, an embryonic homeobox transcription factor Nanog upregulates the wild-type COL3A1 expression through activation of the transforming growth factor-beta pathway, which increases type III collagen synthesis. Despite numerous advancements, more studies are to be performed to incorporate these discoveries into clinical settings, and eventually, more personalized treatments can be created."

Over and above these common features, they differ in the presence or absence of various organ and tissue abnormalities, and differences in genetic causal mechanisms and degree of severity. They are complex and multisystem diseases, with the majority being highly disabling because of major joint problems and neurosensory deficiencies, and in some cases, they may be life-threatening due to associated complications, especially vascular disorders. In 1997, the Villefranche classification defined 6\u00a0subtypes of EDS. However, many other new variants have been described over the last years. The \"historical\" EDS were characterized by abnormalities in fibrillar collagen protein synthesis. More recently, disorders of synthesis and organization of the extracellular matrix have been shown to be responsible for other types of EDS. Thus, many EDS are in fact metabolic diseases related to enzymatic defects. While there is no curative treatment for any type of EDS, early diagnosis is of utmost importance in order to optimize the symptomatic management of patients and to prevent avoidable complications. Patients must be treated and monitored by multidisciplinary teams in highly specialized reference centers.

There are two different nutritional stages reported in an individual with PWS; first stage during infancy marked by feeding and growth difficulties and second stage where hyperphagia starts and leads to development of obesity. However, the exact mechanism of hyperphagia development, from having difficulties in feeding during early years to insatiable appetite after they grow is still unknown and is the focused in this review. The keywords used for literature search such as \"Prader-Willi syndrome\", \"hyperphagia\", \"obesity\", and \"treatment\" were used to create the search strings by using synonyms in order to retrieve the relevant records from PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct. The possible mechanism of hyperphagia can be classed into hormonal abnormalities such as increase in ghrelin and leptin from infancy to adulthood. Low level of hormones was observed in the thyroid, insulin and peptide YY at certain ages. Neuronal abnormalities contributed by Orexin A and brain structure alteration was documented at 4-30 years old. Treatment in the form of drugs such as livoletide, topiramate, and diazoxide could potentially alleviate these abnormalities and make hyperphagia less prominent in PWS. The approaches are important to regulate the hormonal changes and neuronal involvement as potentially controlling hyperphagia and obesity."

The loss of function arises as a result of paternally derived mutations complemented by maternal imprinting. The molecular events underlying the disorder include interstitial deletions (70%), uniparental disomy (UPD) (25%), imprinting center defects (<5%), and rarely chromosomal translocations (<1%). The standard diagnosis of PWS is based on clinical observations and genetic investigations involving DNA methylation studies and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. The absence of a paternal methylation pattern within 15q11 is sufficient for a diagnosis of PWS, and FISH analyses are used for the additional categorization of patients as either deletion or nondeletion. The main limitation of these investigations is that they neither determine the size of the molecular deletions nor permit detection of individuals with microdeletions in the PWS imprinting center that regulates imprinting in this region. We have designed and implemented a real-time PCR assay using genomic DNA and SYBR green I intercalating dye to determine the size of the chromosomal deletions in patients with PWS. This has been successfully performed on genomic DNA isolated from both peripheral blood leukocytes and buccal epithelial cells. Through this assay, the two common deletion classes in PWS were observed, and all results were 100% concordant with previous FISH assays performed on the same patients."

To gain insight into the instability of this region, we characterized its architecture in human and nonhuman primates, reconstructing the evolutionary history of five different inversions that rearranged the region in different species primarily by accumulation of segmental duplications. Comparative analysis of human and nonhuman primate duplication structures suggests a human-specific gain of directly oriented duplications in the regions flanking the GOLGA cores and HERC segmental duplications, representing potential genomic drivers for the human-specific expansions.

The research was not limited to a specific time period and included all articles in such databases.\nDATA SYNTHESIS: The Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder resulting from the loss of imprinted gene expression within the paternal chromosome 15q11-q13. PWS is characterized by endocrine abnormalities, such as growth hormone (GH) deficiency, obesity, central adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism and complex behavioral and intellectual difficulties. PWS individuals also may present other comorbidities, such as sleep disorders, scoliosis, constipation, dental issues and coagulation disorders. The follow-up protocol of the Children's Institute at Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo is based on four main pillars: diet, exercise, recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy and behavioral and cognitive issues. The diet must include a caloric restriction of 900 kcal/day, according to the Prader-Willi Eating Pyramid and exercise plan is focused on daily aerobic exercises and postural therapy. The rhGH therapy is highly recommended by the international scientific literature and must be started as soon as the diagnostic is made. The management of behavioral issues is based on strategies to establish routine and rules.\nCONCLUSIONS: If the general pediatrician becomes more familiar with PWS, the diagnosis and treatment will start earlier, which is essential to improve the quality of life and care for these individuals."

PWS is an example of a genetic condition caused by genomic imprinting. It can occur via 3 main mechanisms that lead to the absence of expression of paternally inherited genes in the 15q11.2-q13 region: paternal microdeletion, maternal uniparental disomy, and an imprinting defect. Over 99% of PWS cases can be diagnosed using DNA methylation analysis. Early diagnosis of PWS is important for effective long-term management. Growth hormone (GH) treatment improves the growth, physical phenotype, and body composition of patients with PWS. In recent years, GH treatment in infants has been shown to have beneficial effects on the growth and neurological development of patients diagnosed during infancy. There is a clear need for an integrated multidisciplinary approach to facilitate early diagnosis and optimize management to improve quality of life, prevent complications, and prolong life expectancy in patients with PWS."

Cognitive and behavioral problems (tantrums, compulsions, compulsive skin picking) are common.\nOBJECTIVE: Hyperphagia and obesity with related complications are major causes of morbidity and mortality in PWS. This report will describe an accurate diagnosis with determination of specific genetic subtypes, appropriate medical management and best practice treatment approaches.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: An extensive literature review was undertaken related to genetics, clinical findings and laboratory testing, clinical and behavioral assessments and summary of updated health-related information addressing the importance of early PWS diagnosis and treatment. A searchable, bulleted and formatted list of topics is provided utilizing a Table of Contents approach for the clinical practitioner.\nCONCLUSION: Physicians and other health care providers can use this review with clinical, genetic and treatment summaries divided into sections pertinent in the context of clinical practice.

Sleep abnormalities and scoliosis are common. Growth hormone insufficiency is frequent, and replacement therapy provides improvement in growth, body composition, and physical attributes. Management is otherwise largely supportive. Consensus clinical diagnostic criteria exist, but diagnosis should be confirmed through genetic testing. Prader-Willi syndrome is due to absence of paternally expressed imprinted genes at 15q11.2-q13 through paternal deletion of this region (65-75% of individuals), maternal uniparental disomy 15 (20-30%), or an imprinting defect (1-3%).

There are multiple imprinted genes in this region, the loss of which contribute to the complete phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome. However, absence of a small nucleolar organizing RNA gene, SNORD116, seems to reproduce many of the clinical features.

The purpose of this study was to show the molecular genetic defects and genomic imprinting basis in Chinese PWS patients and to evaluate the clinical applications of a differential diagnostic test for PWS.\nMETHODS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and methylation-specific PCR (MSPCR) techniques were applied for 4 clinically suspected PWS patients. Using three probes, including SNRPN probe for identification of the critical locus in PWS region, D15Z1 and PML control probes for identification of the 15p arm and 15q arm, the authors detected the deletions 15q in PWS. MSPCR was based on sodium bisulfite treatment of DNA and PCR primers specific for the maternal and paternal allele.\nRESULTS: When hybridized with mixed probes, it was found in 2 patients that the central specific signal was absent, but both the flanking control signals were retained, indicating SNRPN gene deletion of chromosome 15q11-13. Bisulfite-modified DNA from all PWS children amplified with methylated allele-specific primer pair showed only maternal 131bp PCR product, indicating the maternal uniparental disomy (UPD15).\nCONCLUSION: Genomic imprinting plays an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of PWS that caused by paternal microdeletions of 15q11-q13 or maternal UPD of chromosome 15. The basic defect seemed to be an absence of function of PWS genes that are normally expressed only from the paternal chromosome 15. MSPCR is a rapid and simple PCR-based assay compared with other cyto-molecular tests and its results were consistent with the clinical diagnosis of PWS, so it seems to be a reliable diagnostic method for PWS patients who show abnormal methylation at SNRPN. The genetic differential tests for PWS are important in determining familial recurrence risk."

We previously developed a DNA methylation-based PCR assay to identify each of these three genetic causes of PWS. The assay enables straightforward and rapid diagnosis during infancy and therefore allows early intervention such as nutritional management, physical therapy, or growth hormone treatment to prevent PWS patients from complications such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. It is known that various environmental factors induce epigenomic changes during the perinatal period, which increase the risk of adult diseases such as type 2 diabetes and intellectual disabilities. Therefore, a similar preemptive approach as used in PWS would also be applicable to acquired disorders and would make use of environmentally-introduced \"epigenomic signatures\" to aid development of early intervention strategies that take advantage of \"epigenomic reversibility\"."

DNA methylation analysis can detect almost all individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome but is unable to distinguish between the molecular classes of the disease. Thus, additional methods are necessary to identify the molecular classes. Here, we employed chromosomal microarray analysis-single nucleotide polymorphism for diagnosis and detected a long-contiguous stretch of homozygosity on chromosome 15, which is highly predictive of maternal uniparental disomy on chromosome 15. Other methods, including fluorescence in situ hybridization, chromosomal microarray analysis-comparative genomic hybridization, genotyping and family linkage analysis, were performed for further validation.

As a result, the patient has three maternally derived copies of the Prader-Willi syndrome critical region and absence of paternal 15 contribution and thus, presents with a Prader-Willi syndrome phenotype with risk for developing additional phenotypes (e.g., autism and psychiatric phenotypes) characteristic of maternally derived duplications of this region.

This region is governed by genomic imprinting, a phenomenon in which genes are expressed exclusively from one parental allele. The genomic imprinting of the 15q11-q13 locus is established in the germline and is largely controlled by a bipartite imprinting centre. One part, termed the Prader-Willi syndrome imprinting center (PWS-IC), comprises a CpG island that is unmethylated on the paternal allele and methylated on the maternal allele. The second part, termed the Angelman syndrome imprinting centre, is required to silence the PWS_IC in the maternal germline. The loss of the paternal contribution of the imprinted 15q11-q13 locus most frequently occurs owing to a large deletion of the entire imprinted region but can also occur through maternal uniparental disomy or an imprinting defect. While PWS is considered a contiguous gene syndrome based on large-deletion and uniparental disomy patients, the lack of expression of only non-coding RNA transcripts from the SNURF-SNRPN/SNHG14 may be the primary cause of PWS. Patients with small atypical deletions of the paternal SNORD116 cluster alone appear to have most of the PWS related clinical phenotypes. The loss of the maternal contribution of the 15q11-q13 locus causes a separate and distinct condition called Angelman syndrome. Importantly, while much has been learned about the regulation and expression of genes and transcripts deriving from the 15q11-q13 locus, there remains much to be learned about how these genes and transcripts contribute at the molecular level to the clinical traits and developmental aspects of PWS that have been observed."

This region contains a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), HBII-52, that exhibits sequence complementarity to the alternatively spliced exon Vb of the serotonin receptor 5-HT(2C)R. We found that HBII-52 regulates alternative splicing of 5-HT(2C)R by binding to a silencing element in exon Vb. Prader-Willi syndrome patients do not express HBII-52. They have different 5-HT(2C)R messenger RNA (mRNA) isoforms than healthy individuals. Our results show that a snoRNA regulates the processing of an mRNA expressed from a gene located on a different chromosome, and the results indicate that a defect in pre-mRNA processing contributes to the Prader-Willi syndrome."

The majority of PWS-associated matUPD15 cases represent a complete heterodisomy of chromosome 15 or a mixture of hetero- and isodisomic regions across the chromosome 15. Pure maternal isodisomy is observed in only a few matUPD15 patients. Here we report a case of an 18-year-old boy with some clinical features of Prader-Willi syndrome, such as overweight, muscular hypotonia, facial dysmorphism and psychiatric problems, but there was no reason to suspect PWS in the patient based solely on the phenotype estimation. However, chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) revealed mosaic loss of heterozygosity of the entire chromosome 15. Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependant probe amplification (MS-MLPA) analysis showed hypermethylation of the SNRPN and NDN genes in the PWS/AS critical region of chromosome 15 in this patient. Taking into consideration the MS-MLPA results and the presence of PWS features in the patient, we concluded that it was matUPD15, although the patient's parents were not enrolled in the study. According to CMA and karyotyping, no trisomic or monosomic cells were present. To the best of our knowledge, only two PWS cases with mosaic maternal isodisomy 15 and without trisomic/monosomic cell lines have been reported so far."

Early diagnosis of PWS is essential for timely treatment, leading to effectively easing some clinical symptoms. Molecular approaches for PWS diagnosis at the DNA level are available, but the diagnosis of PWS at the RNA level has been limited. Here, we show that a cluster of paternally transcribed snoRNA-ended long noncoding RNAs (sno-lncRNAs, sno-lncRNA1-5) derived from the SNORD116 locus in the PWS region can serve as diagnostic markers. In particular, quantification analysis has revealed that 6,000 copies of sno-lncRNA3 are present in 1\u2009\u03bcL whole blood samples from non-PWS individuals. sno-lncRNA3 is absent in all examined whole blood samples of 8 PWS individuals compared to 42 non-PWS individuals and dried blood samples of 35 PWS individuals compared to 24 non-PWS individuals. Further developing a new CRISPR-MhdCas13c system for RNA detection with a sensitivity of 10 molecules per \u03bcL has ensured sno-lncRNA3 detection in non-PWS, but not PWS individuals. Together, we suggest that the absence of sno-lncRNA3 represents a potential marker for PWS diagnosis that can be detected by both RT-qPCR and CRISPR-MhdCas13c systems with only microlitre amount of blood samples. Such an RNA-based sensitive and convenient approach may facilitate the early detection of PWS."

These genetic anomalies lead to well-described clinical phenotype that includes hypotonia, hypothalamic dysfunction, social and behavioral issues, life-threatening hyperphagia, and elevated probability of obesity. Adolescents with PWS are at the highest risk for development of life-threatening obesity due to increased access to food, decreased physical activity, and hyperphagia. Currently, the only treatment for the hyperphagia is environmental control, including locked kitchens and continuous supervision of the affected individual. Caloric intake must be restricted to prevent obesity, which subsequently increases the hunger drive even more.

Recent studies of rare human translocation patients narrowed the PWS critical genes to a 121-kb region containing PWCR1/HBII-85 and HBII-438 snoRNA genes. The existing mouse models of PWS that lack the expression of multiple genes, including Snrpn, Ube3a, and many intronic snoRNA genes, are characterized by 80%-100% neonatal lethality. To define the candidate region for PWS-like phenotypes in mice, we analyzed the expression of several genetic elements in mice carrying the large radiation-induced p(30PUb) deletion that includes the p locus. Mice having inherited this deletion from either parent develop normally into adulthood. By Northern blot and RT-PCR assays of brain tissue, we found that Pwcr1/MBII-85 snoRNAs are expressed normally, while MBII-52 snoRNAs are not expressed when the deletion is paternally inherited. Mapping of the distal deletion breakpoint indicated that the p30PUb deletion includes the entire MBII-52 snoRNA gene cluster and three previously unmapped EST sequences. The lack of expression of these elements in mice with a paternal p30PUb deletion indicates that they are not critical for the neonatal lethality observed in PWS mouse models. In addition, we identified MBII-436, the mouse homolog of the HBII-436 snoRNA, confirmed its imprinting status, and mapped it outside of the p30PUb deletion. Taking together all available data, we conclude that the lack of Pwcr1/MBII-85 snoRNA expression is the most likely cause for the neonatal lethality in PWS model mice."

It is characterized by severe hypotonia and feeding difficulties in early infancy, followed in later infancy or early childhood by excessive eating and gradual development of morbid obesity. Motor milestones and language development are delayed and most patients have intellectual disability.\nCASE PRESENTATION: Here we describe a rare PWS case caused by mosaic imprinting defect in the region 15q11.2-q13 of paternal origin. The proband was a male child with a clinical presentation of global developmental delay and hypotonia with specific facial features. Karyotype of the child was noted as mosaic: 45XY,der(15)?t(15;21),-21[26]/46,XY[24]. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified a deletion of 22.7\u2009Mb in size at chr15q11.2q21.1 region and a deletion of 2.1\u2009Mb in size at chr21q22.3 region. The Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification(MS-MLPA) of the 15q11.2-q13 region showed that the loading ratio of methylated alleles was 70% and that of unmethylated alleles was 30%(50% normal), which confirmed that the loss of mosaic imprinted defects in the paternal allele led to the diagnosis of PWS.\nCONCLUSIONS: We propose that complete clinical criteria for PWS should not be considered sensitive in diagnosing partial atypical PWS due to mosaic imprinting defects. In contrast, clinical suspicion based on less restrictive criteria followed by multiple techniques is a more powerful approach."

A further 25-30% of patients with Prader-Willi syndrome do not have paternal deletions, the defect being due to uniparental disomy (UPD) for maternal chromosome 15. Paternal deletions and maternal UPD are functionally equivalent, as they both result in the absence of a paternal contribution to the genome in the 15q11-13 region. The SNRPN (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated polypeptide N) gene has a critical role in the 15q11-13 region, as it is probably part of the putative imprinting centre that regulates the expression of several genes in the Prader-Willi syndrome transcriptional domain.

Early diagnosis and management of PWS can significantly improve outcomes for patients and their families. Methods In this study, we analyzed a group of 29 clinically diagnosed patients suspected of PWS. All patients were referred to the medical genetics and onco-genetics service for genetic consultation and molecular analysis. We used DNA methylation analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to confirm the diagnosis and identify the underlying genetic mechanisms. Results Our analysis showed that five out of seven patients (71.43%) with a positive methylation-specific PCR (MSP) had chromosomal deletion by FISH and presented major clinical signs summarized by morbid obesity in 65.21% of cases and neonatal hypotonia in 42.85% of cases. This finding indicates that paternal 15q11-q13 deletion is the most common genetic mechanism involved in PWS. Conclusion The results of this study highlight the importance of early diagnosis and molecular analysis in the management of Prader-Willi syndrome. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation in the Moroccan population and provide families with a rigorous molecular diagnosis, relevant genetic counseling, and multidisciplinary support.

There are multiple genetic causes, although all ultimately involve the loss of paternally derived gene expression of chromosome region 15q11-q13. Multiple imprinted genes expressed only from the paternal allele have been identified in the specific region of human chromosome 15q associated with Prader-Willi syndrome and in the syntenic mouse chromosome 7C region, including a novel polycistronic gene (SNURF-SNRPN) that encodes two independent proteins. The latter genetic locus may play a key role in Prader-Willi syndrome and the evolution of imprinting in this domain, because it is uniquely involved with mutations in the imprinting process and balanced translocations in this syndrome. Indeed, based on the co-localization of SNURF and SNRPN within the imprinting control region critical to Prader-Willi syndrome, evolutionary arguments would suggest that this genetic locus is a prime candidate for mutations producing the failure-to-thrive phenotype of neonates with this syndrome and of corresponding mouse models.

Predominant features include infantile hypotonia, a poor suck with failure to thrive, craniofacial features, and developmental and behavioral problems including self-injury and childhood onset of obesity. In addition to severe obesity, patients with PWS present with other symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction.\nMETHODS: We examined the features seen in Prader-Willi syndrome and searched the literature for evidence of autonomic nervous system involvement in this rare obesity-related disorder and illustrative findings possibly due to autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Additionally, we reviewed the literature in relation to childhood obesity syndromes and compared those syndromes to the syndromic obesity found in Prader-Willi syndrome.\nRESULTS: We report autonomic nervous system-related symptoms associated with childhood obesity impacting features seen in Prader-Willi syndrome and possibly other obesity-related genetic syndromes. We compiled evidence of both an autonomic route for the obesity seen in PWS and other autonomic nervous system-related dysfunctions. These include decreased salvation, sleep disordered breathing, increased pain and thermal threshold instability, delayed gastric emptying, altered blood pressure readings, and pupillary constriction responses as evidence of autonomic nervous system involvement.\nCONCLUSIONS: We summarized and illustrated findings of autonomic nervous system dysfunction in Prader-Willi syndrome and other obesity-related syndromes and genetic factors that may play a causative role in development."

It affects around 700,000 people around the globe. Mutations in the gene coding for hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase cause this deficiency resulting in elevated plasma phenylalanine concentrations, leading to cognitive impairment, neuromotor disorders and related behavioural symptoms. Inception of low phenylalanine diet in the 1950s marked a revolution in the management of phenylketonuria and has since been a vital element of all therapeutic regimens. However, compliance to dietary therapy has been found difficult and newer supplement approaches are being examined. The current development of gene therapy and enzyme replacement therapeutics may offer promising alternatives for the management of phenylketonuria. This review outlines the pathological basis of phenylketonuria, various treatment regimes, their associated challenges and the future prospects of each approach. Briefly, novel drug delivery systems which can potentially deliver therapeutic strategies in phenylketonuria have been discussed."

The resultant hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) leads to severe neurological impairment, whose pathogenesis has not been entirely elucidated. Treatment of PKU consists essentially in lifelong protein restriction and, in mild cases, in tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation. However, compliance to both strategies, particularly to the long-term diet, is low and therefore other therapies are desirable. We explored a gene therapy approach aimed at long-term correction of the pathologic phenotype of BTBR-PahEnu2 mice, a mouse model of PKU. To this aim, we developed a helper-dependent adenoviral (HD-Ad) vector expressing phenylalanine hydroxylase and administered it to 3-week-old PKU mice. This resulted in complete normalization of Phe and Tyr levels and reversal of coat hypopigmentation that lasted throughout the observation period of six months. The spatial learning deficits observed in PKU mice were also reversed and hippocampus levels of the N-methyl-D-Aspartate and 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2- oxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid receptor subunits returned to normal. Long-term potentiation, which is impaired in PKU mice, was also restored by treatment. Therefore, HD-Ad vector-mediated gene therapy is a promising approach to PKU treatment."

In this study, we identified the expression of genes related to pathologic abnormalities of the PKU-affected brain, in which the symptoms of PKU are mainly manifest, and transcriptional changes in effective gene therapy treatment using oligonucleotide array. Therapeutic effectiveness was verified by change in enzyme activity (15+/-5.84%), phenylalanine plasma level (261+/-108 microM), and coat color. Our data indicated that 12 genes were significantly up-regulated in PKU. Four are involved in defense and inflammatory responses of neutrophils (NE, MPO, NGP, and CRAMP), three other overexpressed genes are related to extracellular matrix organization and degradation (COL1A1, COL1A2, and MMP13); the remainder were a nociceptor in sensory neurons (MrgA1), a structural gene of P lysozyme (Lzp-s), an immunoglobulin alpha heavy chain constant region gene (Igh-2), an osteocalcin-related protein precursor (Bglap-rs1), and a membrane-spanning 4 domain, subfamily A, member 3 (Ms4a3). Data demonstrated that elevated genes in the PKU-affected brain could be normalized by human PAH gene delivery. Although we could not precisely link transcript level changes and neurologic pathogenesis, this study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the PKU-affected brain at the molecular level, possibly resulting in better therapeutic approaches."

While locomotory activity over 24 h and exploratory behavior were significantly decreased in untreated PAH(enu2) mice compared with the age-matched controls, these indices were completely normalized in 12-month-old male PKU mice with lowered serum phenylalanine.

In contrast, a vector derived from a recombinant adenovirus can restore 10%-80% of normal hepatic PAH activity into PAH-deficient mice, which completely normalizes serum phenylalanine levels. This treatment is transient and cannot be effectively re-administered due to the presence of neutralizing antibodies directed against the recombinant adenoviral vector.

When a solution containing 1.2 x 10(9) plaque-forming units of the recombinant adenovirus was infused into tail veins of PKU model mice (Pah(enu2)), predominant expression of PAH activity was observed in the liver. The gene transfer normalized the serum phenylalanine level within 24 h. However, it also provoked a profound host immune response against the recombinant virus; as a consequence, the biochemical changes lasted for only 10 d and rechallenge with the virus failed to reduce the serum phenylalanine concentration. Administration of an immunosuppressant, FK506, to mice successfully blocked the host immune response, prolonged the duration of gene expression to more than 35 d, and allowed repeated gene delivery. We noted a change in coat pigmentation from grayish to black after gene delivery. The current study is the first to demonstrate the reversal of hypopigmentation, one of the major clinical phenotypes of PKU in mice as well as in humans, by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, suggesting the feasibility of gene therapy for PKU."

Restriction of dietary phenylalanine intake remains the standard of PKU care and prevents the major neurologic manifestations of the disease, yet shortcomings of dietary therapy remain, including poor adherence to a difficult and unpalatable diet, an increased incidence of neuropsychiatric illness, and imperfect neurocognitive outcomes. Gene therapy for PKU is a promising novel approach to promote lifelong neurological protection while allowing unrestricted dietary phenylalanine intake. In this study, liver-tropic recombinant AAV2/8 vectors were used to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 machinery and facilitate correction of the Pah enu2 allele by homologous recombination. Additionally, a non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) inhibitor, vanillin, was co-administered with the viral drug to promote homology-directed repair (HDR) with the AAV-provided repair template. This combinatorial drug administration allowed for lifelong, permanent correction of the Pah enu2 allele in a portion of treated hepatocytes of mice with PKU, yielding partial restoration of liver PAH activity, substantial reduction of blood phenylalanine, and prevention of maternal PKU effects during breeding. This work reveals that CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing is a promising tool for permanent PKU gene editing."

Here, we designed a gene therapy strategy using AAV to deliver a human codon-optimized phenylalanine amino lyase in a liver-specific manner. It was shown that PAL was active in lysing phenylalanine when it was expressed in mammalian cells. We produced a recombinant adeno-associated vector serotype 8 (AAV8) viral vector expressing the humanized PAL under the control of human antitrypsin (hAAT) promoter (AAV8-PAL). A single intravenous administration of AAV8-PAL caused long-term correction of hyperphenylalaninemia in both male and female PKU mice (strain Pahenu2). Besides, no obvious liver injury was observed throughout the treatment process.

It is an autosomal recessive disorder with a rate of incidence of 1 in 10,000 in Caucasian populations. Mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene are the major cause of PKU, due to the loss of the catalytic activity of the enzyme product PAH. Newborn screening for PKU allows early intervention, avoiding irreparable neurological damage and intellectual disability that would arise from untreated PKU. The current primary treatment of PKU is the limitation of dietary protein intake, which in the long term may be associated with poor compliance in some cases and other health problems due to malnutrition. The only alternative therapy currently approved is the supplementation of BH4, the requisite co-factor of PAH, in the orally-available form of sapropterin dihydrochloride. This treatment is not universally available, and is only effective for a proportion (estimated 30%) of PKU patients. Research into novel therapies for PKU has taken many different approaches to address the lack of PAH activity at the core of this disorder: enzyme replacement via virus-mediated gene transfer, transplantation of donor liver and recombinant PAH protein, enzyme substitution using phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) to provide an alternative pathway for the metabolism of phenylalanine, and restoration of native PAH activity using chemical chaperones and nonsense read-through agents. It is hoped that continuing efforts into these studies will translate into a significant improvement in the physical outcome, as well as quality of life, for patients with PKU."

To explore a long-term nondietary restriction treatment, a somatic gene transfer approach in a PKU mouse model (C57Bl/6-Pahenu2) was employed to examine its preclinical feasibility. A recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector containing the murine Pah-cDNA was generated, pseudotyped with capsids from AAV serotype 8, and delivered into the liver of PKU mice via single intraportal or tail vein injections. The blood Phe concentrations decreased to normal levels (< or =100 microM or 1.7 mg/dl) 2 weeks after vector application, independent of the sex of the PKU animals and the route of application. In particular, the therapeutic long-term correction in females was also dramatic, which had previously been shown to be difficult to achieve. Therapeutic ranges of Phe were accompanied by the phenotypic reversion from brown to black hair. In treated mice, PAH enzyme activity in whole liver extracts reversed to normal and neither hepatic toxicity nor immunogenicity was observed. In contrast, a lentiviral vector expressing the murine Pah-cDNA, delivered via intraportal vein injection into PKU mice, did not result in therapeutic levels of blood Phe. This study demonstrates the complete correction of hyperphenylalaninemia in both males and females with a rAAV serotype 8 vector. More importantly, the feasibility of a single intravenous injection may pave the way to develop a clinical gene therapy procedure for PKU patients."

Alternative therapies under investigation include, among others, the use of gene therapy to provide copies of wild-type, non-mutant, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme. Expression of PAH in both liver (the usual metabolic source of this enzyme) and skeletal muscle is under investigation. Liver gene therapy, using a viral vector based on the adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), provided effective clearance of serum Phe that was sustained for 1 year in some mice. In order for PAH expression to be effective in skeletal muscle, the essential metabolic cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), must also be provided, either by supplementation or gene therapy. Both these approaches were effective. When transgenic PKU mice that constitutively expressed PAH in muscle were given intraperitoneal supplementation with BH(4), this produced (transient) effective clearance of Phe to normal levels. In addition, use of an AAV vector containing the genes for PAH, and for two key synthetic enzymes for BH(4), provided substantial and long-lasting correction (more than 1 year) of blood Phe levels when injected into skeletal muscle of PKU mice.

Mutations in this gene have been described as cause of wide spectrum of neurological disorders and mental retardation in males.

Here we report the identification of the novel truncating mutation Y120X in a 4-year-old child with atypical RS phenotype. Chromosome analysis showed a normal karyotype, and blood DNA and tissue DNA analysis reveal a mosaic for the mutation.

The MeCP2 protein was originally thought to function as a transcription repressor by binding to methylated CpG dinucleotides, but is now also thought to be a transcription activator. Recent studies suggest that MeCP2 is not only being expressed in neurons, but also in glial cells, which suggests a new paradigm for understanding the pathogenesis of RTT. It has also been demonstrated that reintroduction of MeCP2 into behaviorally affected Mecp2-null mice after birth rescues neurological symptoms, which indicates that epigenetic failures in RTT are reversible. Therefore, RTT may well be seen as a model disease that can be potentially treated by taking advantage of the reversibility of epigenetic phenomena in various congenital neurodevelopmental diseases that were previously thought to be untreatable."

Since central nervus system requires precise gene regulation, neurological diseases including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases may be caused by acquired DNA modification (epigenomic) changes that results in aberrant gene regulation as well as DNA sequence changes congenitally occurred (mutation)."

Deficient K+-Cl-co-transporter 2 (KCC2) expression is suggested to play a key role in the neurodevelopmental delay in RTT patients' neuronal networks. KCC2 is a major player in neuronal maturation by supporting the GABAergic switch, through the regulation of neuronal chlorine homeostasis. Previous studies suggest that MeCP2 mutations lead to changed KCC2 expression levels, thereby causing a disturbance in excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance. To investigate this, we performed protein and RNA expression analysis on post mortem brain tissue from RTT patients and healthy controls. We showed that KCC2 expression, in particular the KCC2a isoform, is relatively decreased in RTT patients. The expression of Na+-K+-Cl- co-transporter 1 (NKCC1), responsible for the inward transport of chlorine, is not affected, leading to a reduced KCC2/NKCC1 ratio in RTT brains. Our report confirms KCC2 expression alterations in RTT patients in human brain tissue, which is in line with other studies, suggesting affected E/I balance could underlie neurodevelopmental defects in RTT patients."

Mutations in the MECP2 gene are responsible for 95% of the diagnosed RTT cases and the mechanisms through which these mutations relate with symptomatology are still elusive. Children with RTT present a period of apparent normal development followed by a rapid regression in speech and behavior and a progressive deterioration of motor abilities. Epilepsy is one of the most common symptoms in RTT, occurring in 60 to 80% of RTT cases, being associated with worsening of other symptoms. At this point, no cure for RTT is available and there is a pressing need for the discovery of new drug candidates to treat its severe symptoms. However, despite being a rare disease, in the last decade research in RTT has grown exponentially. New and exciting evidence has been gathered and the etiopathogenesis of this complex, severe and untreatable disease is slowly being unfolded. Advances in gene editing techniques have prompted cure-oriented research in RTT. Nonetheless, at this point, finding a cure is a distant reality, highlighting the importance of further investigating the basic pathological mechanisms of this disease. In this review, we focus our attention in some of the newest evidence on RTT clinical and preclinical research, evaluating their impact in RTT symptomatology control, and pinpointing possible directions for future research."

We report on a girl who, at age 2 months, developed an acute encephalopathy with destructive brain damage 12 hours after acellular pertussis vaccination. Peripheral lymphocyte subset analysis revealed the existence of T lymphocytes double positive for CD4 and CD8 markers. This pattern normalized over the following 3 months. Months later, the girl manifested a Rett syndrome phenotype. DNA screening of the MECP2 gene was unrevealing in the child and her parents.

Neurologically, patients with all three disorders display microcephaly, aberrant dendritic morphology, reduced spine density, and an imbalance of excitatory/inhibitory signaling. Loss-of-function mutations in the cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) and FOXG1 genes also cause similar behavioral and neurobiological defects and were referred to as congenital or variant Rett syndrome. The relatively recent realization that CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), FOXG1 syndrome, and Rett syndrome are distinct neurodevelopmental disorders with some distinctive features have resulted in separate focus being placed on each disorder with the assumption that distinct molecular mechanisms underlie their pathogenesis. However, given that many of the core symptoms and neurological features are shared, it is likely that the disorders share some critical molecular underpinnings. This review discusses the possibility that deregulation of common molecules in neurons and astrocytes plays a central role in key behavioral and neurological abnormalities in all three disorders. These include KCC2, a chloride transporter, vGlut1, a vesicular glutamate transporter, GluD1, an orphan-glutamate receptor subunit, and PSD-95, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein. We propose that reduced expression or activity of KCC2, vGlut1, PSD-95, and AKT, along with increased expression of GluD1, is involved in the excitatory/inhibitory that represents a key aspect in all three disorders. In addition, astrocyte-derived brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and inflammatory cytokines likely affect the expression and functioning of these molecules resulting in disease-associated abnormalities."

Mutations of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene are the most prevalent cause of classical RTT cases. MECP2 mutations or altered expression are also associated with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders with recent links to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Collectively, MeCP2 relation to these neurodevelopmental disorders highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms by which MeCP2 impacts brain development, mental conditions, and compromised brain function. Since MECP2 mutations were discovered to be the primary cause of RTT, a significant progress has been made in the MeCP2 research, with respect to the expression, function and regulation of MeCP2 in the brain and its contribution in RTT pathogenesis. To date, there have been intensive efforts in designing effective therapeutic strategies for RTT benefiting from mouse models and cells collected from RTT patients. Despite significant progress in MeCP2 research over the last few decades, there is still a knowledge gap between the in vitro and in vivo research findings and translating these findings into effective therapeutic interventions in human RTT patients. In this review, we will provide a synopsis of Rett syndrome as a severe neurological disorder and will discuss the role of MeCP2 in RTT pathophysiology."

RTT is caused by heterozygosity for mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2, which encodes methyl-CpG binding protein 2. MeCP2 is a multifunctional protein that can act as an architectural chromatin-binding protein, a function that is unrelated to its ability to bind methyl-CpG and to attract chromatin modification complexes. Inactivating mutations that cause RTT in females are not prenatally lethal in males, but lead to profound congenital encephalopathy. Molecular diagnoses of RTT, through demonstration of a MECP2 mutation, made at an early stage of the disorder, usually confirm the sporadic nature and very low recurrence risk of the condition. A positive DNA test result, however, also predicts the inevitable clinical course, given the lack of effective intervention. Initial hypotheses indicating that the MeCP2 protein acts as a genome-wide transcriptional repressor were not confirmed by global gene expression studies in various tissues of individuals with RTT and mouse models of MeCP2 deficiency. Rather, recent evidence points to low-magnitude effects of a small number of genes--including the brain--derived neurotrophic factor pathway and glucocorticoid response genes-that might affect formation and maturation of synapses or synaptic function in postmitotic neurons."

Females with Rett syndrome are usually heterozygous for a mutation in MECP2. Uniparental disomy as a probable cause for the homozygous presence of this mutation was ruled out by quantitative fluorescence-polymerase chain reaction. Moreover to our knowledge this mutation has only been reported in males with X-linked mental retardation (MRX). We hypothesize that the presence of this mutation c.1160C>T (P387L) in the homozygous form is responsible for the Rett syndrome-like phenotype seen in this patient. This novel report reveals for the first time the homozygous presence of a mutation which has hitherto only been reported in males with MRX."

Such MeCP2 alterations often result in changes to DNA binding and chromatin clustering ability, and in the stability of this protein. Among other functions, MeCP2 binds to methylated genomic DNA, which represents an important epigenetic mark with broad physiological implications, including neuronal development. In this review, we will summarize the genetic foundations behind RTT, and the variable degrees of protein stability exhibited by MeCP2 and its mutated versions. Also, past and emerging relationships that MeCP2 has with mRNA splicing, miRNA processing, and other non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) will be explored, and we suggest that these molecules could be missing links in understanding the epigenetic consequences incurred from genetic ablation of this important chromatin modifier. Importantly, although MeCP2 is highly expressed in the brain, where it has been most extensively studied, the role of this protein and its alterations in other tissues cannot be ignored and will also be discussed. Finally, the additional complexity to RTT pathology introduced by structural and functional implications of the two MeCP2 isoforms (MeCP2-E1 and MeCP2-E2) will be described. Epigenetic therapeutics are gaining clinical popularity, yet treatment for Rett syndrome is more complicated than would be anticipated for a purely epigenetic disorder, which should be taken into account in future clinical contexts."

About 80% of classic Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene for methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCP2) in Xq28. MeCP2 links DNA methylation to transcriptional repression, and MECP2 mutations likely cause partial or complete loss of function of the protein, leading to inappropriate transcription of downstream genes at critical times in brain development. More severe and milder variant forms can all be caused by similar mutations. Most classic Rett syndrome patients have random X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), but skewed patterns are present in a few. All asymptomatic or mildly mentally delayed female carriers studied to date have non-random XCI patterns, suggesting that this attenuates the deleterious effects of the MECP2 mutations in these women. The finding of non-random XCI patterns in some patients with very early truncations is consistent with this observation and supports that many mutations could cause partial and not complete loss of function. Our observation that the mutant mRNA is stable in three patients with truncating mutations supports this possibility. Further studies will have to be performed to better understand the functional consequences of MECP2 mutations in RTT."

However, neither the longitudinal course of epilepsy nor the patterns of seizure onset and remission have been described in Rett syndrome and related conditions. The present study summarizes the findings of the Rett syndrome Natural History study. Participants with clinical Rett syndrome and those with MECP2 mutations without the clinical syndrome were recruited through the Rett Natural History study from 2006 to 2015. Clinical details were collected, and cumulative lifetime prevalence of epilepsy was determined using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Risk factors for epilepsy were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Of 1205 participants enrolled in the study, 922 had classic Rett syndrome, and 778 of these were followed longitudinally for 3939 person-years. The diagnosis of atypical Rett syndrome with a severe clinical phenotype was associated with higher prevalence of epilepsy than those with classic Rett syndrome. While point prevalence of active seizures ranged from 30% to 44%, the estimated cumulative lifetime prevalence of epilepsy using Kaplan-Meier approached 90%. Specific MECP2 mutations were not significantly associated with either seizure prevalence or seizure severity. In contrast, many clinical features were associated with seizure prevalence; frequency of hospitalizations, inability to walk, bradykinesia, scoliosis, gastrostomy feeding, age of seizure onset, and late age of diagnosis were independently associated with higher odds of an individual having epilepsy. Aggressive behaviour was associated with lower odds. Three distinct patterns of seizure prevalence emerged in classic Rett syndrome, including those who did not have seizures throughout the study, those who had frequent relapse and remission, and those who had relentless seizures. Although 248 of those with classic Rett syndrome and a history of seizures were in terminal remission at last contact, only 74 (12% of those with a history of epilepsy) were seizure free and off anti-seizure medication. When studied longitudinally, point prevalence of active seizures is relatively low in Rett syndrome, although lifetime risk of epilepsy is higher than previously reported. While daily seizures are uncommon in Rett syndrome, prolonged remission is less common than in other causes of childhood onset epilepsy. Complete remission off anti-seizure medications is possible, but future efforts should be directed at determining what factors predict when withdrawal of medications in those who are seizure free is propitious."

Here, we investigate the effect of a novel MECP2 L124W missense mutation in the MBD of an atypical RTT patient with preserved speech in comparison to severe MECP2 null mutations. L124W protein had a limited ability to disrupt heterochromatic chromocenters due to decreased binding dynamics. We isolated two pairs of isogenic WT and L124W induced pluripotent stem cells. L124W induced excitatory neurons expressed stable protein, exhibited increased input resistance and decreased voltage-gated Na+ and K+ currents, and their neuronal dysmorphology was limited to decreased dendritic complexity. Three isogenic pairs of MECP2 null neurons had the expected more extreme morphological and electrophysiological phenotypes. We examined development and maturation of L124W and MECP2 null excitatory neural network activity using micro-electrode arrays. Relative to isogenic controls, L124W neurons had an increase in synchronous network burst frequency, in contrast to MECP2 null neurons that suffered a significant decrease in synchronous network burst frequency and a transient extension of network burst duration. A biologically motivated computational neural network model shows the observed changes in network dynamics are explained by changes in intrinsic Na+ and K+ currents in individual neurons. Our multilevel results demonstrate that RTT excitatory neurons show a wide spectrum of morphological, electrophysiological and circuitry phenotypes that are dependent on the severity of the MECP2 mutation."

While studies in mice have demonstrated a clear causative - and potential therapeutic - role for neurons in Rett syndrome, recent work has suggested that other tissues also contribute significantly to progression of the disease. Indeed, Rett syndrome is known to present with several common peripheral pathologies, such as osteopenia, scoliosis, gastrointestinal problems including nutritional defects, and general growth deficit. Mouse models assessing the potential role of non-neuronal cell types have confirmed both roles in disease and potential therapeutic targets. A new picture is emerging in which neurons both initiate and drive pathology, while dysfunction of other cell types and peripheral tissues exacerbate disease, possibly amplifying further neurologic problems, and ultimately result in a positive feedback loop of progressively worsening symptoms.

This reduced UBE3A level was associated with biallelic production of the UBE3A antisense RNA. In addition, MeCP2 deficiency resulted in elevated histone H3 acetylation and H3(K4) methylation and reduced H3(K9) methylation at the PWS/AS imprinting center, with no effect on DNA methylation or SNRPN expression. We conclude, therefore, that MeCP2 deficiency causes epigenetic aberrations at the PWS imprinting center. These changes in histone modifications result in loss of imprinting of the UBE3A antisense gene in the brain, increase in UBE3A antisense RNA level and, consequently reduction in UBE3A production."

It is currently considered a monogenic X-linked dominant disorder due to mutations in MECP2 gene, encoding the methyl-CpG binding protein 2. A few RTT male cases, resulting from mosaicism for MECP2 mutations, have been reported. Male germline MECP2 mutations cause either severe encephalopathy with death at birth (usually in brothers of classical RTT females) or X-linked recessive mental retardation (XLMR). To date the wide phenotypic heterogeneity associated with MECP2 mutations in females (from classical RTT to healthy carriers) has been explained by differences in X chromosome inactivation. However, conflicting results have been obtained in different studies, with both random and highly skewed X-inactivation reported in healthy carrier females. Consequently it is possible that mechanisms other than X-inactivation play a role in the expressivity of MECP2 mutations. To explain the phenotypic heterogeneity associated with MECP2 mutations we propose a digenic model in which the presence of a \"mutated\" allele in a second gene, leading to a less functional protein, determines the clinical severity of the MECP2 mutation. The model is supported by the identification of the same mutation in XLMR and RTT cases. The carrier mothers of XLMR families are clinically asymptomatic and present balanced X chromosome inactivation. Therefore the same mutation arising in different genetic backgrounds can cause XLMR in males, remain silent in the carrier females and cause classic RTT in females. MECP2 mutations account for approximately 70-80% of classic RTT cases. MECP2 negative cases might result from mutations in noncoding regions of MECP2 gene. Alternatively, these cases might be due to mutations in other genes (locus heterogeneity). This hypothesis is supported by the identification of several chromosomal rearrangements in MECP2 negative patients with RTT and RTT-like phenotypes. MeCP2 is considered a general transcriptional repressor. However, conditional mouse mutants with selective loss of Mecp2 in the brain develop clinical manifestations similar to RTT, indicating that MECP2 is exclusively required for central nervous system function. The involvement of MeCP2 in methylation-specific transcriptional repression suggests that MECP2 related disorders result from dysregulated gene expression. Studies on gene expression have been performed in mouse and human brains. A relatively small number of gene expression changes were identified. It is possible that MeCP2 causes dysregulation of a very small subset of genes that are not detected with this method of analysis, or that very subtle changes in many genes cause the neuronal phenotype."

The syndrome is primarily caused by mutations in the Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene on Xq28. Its protein product MeCP2 acts as a transcriptional repressor or activator depending on the target gene associated. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophic factor playing a major role in neuronal survival, neurogenesis and plasticity. It has been identified as a major MeCP2 target through a candidate gene approach and abnormalities in BDNF homeostasis are believed to contribute to the neurologic phenotype and pato-physiology of part of the symptoms in Mecp2 null mice that show progressive deficits in its expression. Based on the presumed role of BDNF in the pathophysiology of Rett syndrome it is reasonable to assume that interventions that will elevate its levels in the brain of RTT patients will be of therapeutic benefit. Glatiramer acetate (GA, Copolymer 1, Copaxone) an immunomodulator with proven safety and efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis has been reported to cause elevated secretion of BDNF both in animal model and in MS patients. Our hypothesis is that continuous treatment of patients with RTT with Glatiramer acetate might lead to an increase in their brain's BDNF content and an improvement in at least part of the syndrome symptomatology while being safe to use and well tolerated in this population. In a pilot preliminary study we have shown that GA cause elevation of BDNF expression up to the level in na\u00efve control mice in several cortical areas in the Mecp2 mutated mouse brain, but as of yet did not examine the behavioral aspects of this elevation."

In classic Rett syndrome, genotype-phenotype correlation studies suggest that X chromosome inactivation patterns have a more prominent effect on clinical severity than the type of mutation. When the full range of phenotypes associated with MECP2 mutations is considered, however, the mutation type strongly affects disease severity. MeCP2 is a transcriptional repressor that binds to methylated CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome, and mutations in Rett syndrome patients are thought to result in at least a partial loss of function. Abnormal gene expression may thus underlie the phenotype.

To determine what role excitatory signaling impairment might play in RTT pathogenesis, we generated conditional mouse models with Mecp2 either removed from or expressed solely in glutamatergic neurons. MeCP2 deficiency in glutamatergic neurons leads to early lethality, obesity, tremor, altered anxiety-like behaviors, and impaired acoustic startle response, which is distinct from the phenotype of mice lacking MeCP2 only in inhibitory neurons.

MECP2 codes for methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2), a transcriptional regulator that activates genetic programs for experience-dependent plasticity. Many neural and behavioral symptoms of Rett syndrome may result from dysregulated timing and threshold for plasticity. As a model of adult plasticity, we examine changes to auditory cortex inhibitory circuits in female mice when they are first exposed to pups; this plasticity facilitates behavioral responses to pups emitting distress calls. Brain-wide deletion of Mecp2 alters expression of markers associated with GABAergic parvalbumin interneurons (PVin) and impairs the emergence of pup retrieval. We hypothesized that loss of Mecp2 in PVin disproportionately contributes to the phenotype. Here we find that deletion of Mecp2 from PVin delayed the onset of maternal retrieval behavior and recapitulated the major molecular and neurophysiological features of brain-wide deletion of Mecp2 . We observed that when PVin-selective mutants were exposed to pups, auditory cortical expression of PVin markers increased relative to that in wild type littermates. PVin-specific mutants also failed to show the inhibitory auditory cortex plasticity seen in wild type mice upon exposure to pups and their vocalizations. Finally, using an intersectional viral genetic strategy, we demonstrate that post-developmental loss of Mecp2 in PVin of the auditory cortex is sufficient to delay onset of maternal retrieval. Our results support a model in which PVin play a central role in adult cortical plasticity and may be particularly impaired by loss of Mecp2 .\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that includes deficits in both communication and the ability to update brain connections and activity during learning ('plasticity'). This condition is caused by mutations in the gene MECP2 . We use a maternal behavioral test in mice requiring both vocal perception and neural plasticity to probe Mecp2' s role in social and sensory learning. Mecp2 is normally active in all brain cells, but here we remove it from a specific population ('parvalbumin neurons'). We find that this is sufficient to delay learned behavioral responses to pups and recreates many deficits seen in whole brain Mecp2 deletion. Our findings suggest that parvalbumin neurons specifically are central to the consequences of loss of Mecp2 activity and yield clues as to possible mechanisms by which Rett syndrome impairs brain function."

While the exact etiology of RTT symptoms remains unknown, one possible explanation for its clinical presentation is that loss of MeCP2 causes miswiring of neural circuits due to defects in the brain's capacity to respond to changes in neuronal activity and sensory experience. Here we show that MeCP2 is phosphorylated at four residues in the brain (S86, S274, T308, and S421) in response to neuronal activity, and we generate a quadruple knock-in (QKI) mouse line in which all four activity-dependent sites are mutated to alanines to prevent phosphorylation. QKI mice do not display overt RTT phenotypes or detectable gene expression changes in two brain regions. However, electrophysiological recordings from the retinogeniculate synapse of QKI mice reveal that while synapse elimination is initially normal at P14, it is significantly compromised at P20. Notably, this phenotype is distinct from that previously reported for Mecp2 null mice, where synapses initially refine but then regress after the third postnatal week. We thus propose a model in which activity-induced phosphorylation of MeCP2 is critical for the proper timing of retinogeniculate synapse maturation specifically during the early postnatal period.\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder that predominantly affects girls. RTT is caused by loss of function mutations in a single gene MeCP2. Girls with RTT develop normally during their first year of life, but then experience neurological abnormalities including breathing and movement difficulties, loss of speech, and seizures. This study investigates the function of the MeCP2 protein in the brain, and how MeCP2 activity is modulated by sensory experience in early life. Evidence is presented that sensory experience affects MeCP2 function, and that this is required for synaptic pruning in the brain. These findings provide insight into MeCP2 function, and clues as to what goes awry in the brain when the function of MeCP2 is disrupted."

Girls with Rett syndrome exhibit mosaic expression for the MeCP2 defect at the cellular level, with most patients showing random X-inactivation and approximately equal numbers of cells expressing the normal MeCP2 gene and the mutated MeCP2 gene. In rare cases, females with a MeCP2 mutation escape phenotypic expression of the disorder because of nonrandom X-inactivation and the preferential inactivation of the mutated MeCP2 allele. Nonrandom patterns of X-inactivation may also contribute to the clinical variability often seen in girls with Rett syndrome. The spectrum of clinical phenotype caused by MeCP2 mutations is wide, including milder \"preserved speech\" variants, the severe congenital Rett variant, and a subset of X-linked recessive mental retardation in boys.

These region-specific modifications often coincide with phenotype onset and contribute to larger issues of circuit connectivity, progression, and severity.

RTT is known to be caused in 95% of the cases by sporadic de novo loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a nuclear protein able to regulate gene expression.

Oxidative stress (OS) is involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, although in many cases it is not clear whether OS is a cause or a consequence of the pathology. Fairly recently, the presence of a systemic OS has been demonstrated in RTT patients with a strong correlation with the patients' clinical status. The link between MECP2 mutation and the redox imbalance found in RTT is not clear. Animal studies have suggested a possible direct correlation between Mecp2 mutation and increased OS levels. In addition, the restoration of Mecp2 function in astrocytes significantly improves the developmental outcome of Mecp2-null mice and reexpression of Mecp2 gene in the brain of null mice restored oxidative damage, suggesting that Mecp2 loss of function can be involved in oxidative brain damage. Starting from the evidence that oxidative damage in the brain of Mecp2-null mice precedes the onset of symptoms, we evaluated whether, based on the current literature, the dysfunctions described in RTT could be a consequence or, in contrast, could be caused by OS. We also analyzed whether therapies that at least partially treated some RTT symptoms can play a role in defense against OS. At this stage we can propose that OS could be one of the main causes of the dysfunctions observed in RTT. In addition, the major part of the therapies recommended to alleviate RTT symptoms have been shown to interfere with oxidative homeostasis, suggesting that MeCP2 could somehow be involved in the protection of the brain from OS."

Patients with RS have severe motor abnormalities and are often unable to walk, use hands and speak. The preservation of perceptual and cognitive functions is hard to assess, while clinicians and care-givers point out that these patients need more time to process information than typically developing peers. Neurophysiological correlates of auditory processing have been also found to be distorted in RS, but sound presentation rates were relatively quick in these studies (stimulus onset asynchrony, SOA\u2009<\u20091000\u00a0ms). As auditory event-related potential (ERP) is typically increased with prolongation of SOA we aim to study if SOA prolongation might compensate for observed abnormalities.\nMETHODS: We presented a repetitive stimulus (1000\u00a0Hz) at three different SOAs of 900\u00a0ms, 1800\u00a0ms, and 3600\u00a0ms in children with RS (N\u2009=\u200924, Mean age\u2009=\u20099.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1) and their typical development (TD) peers (N\u2009=\u200927, Mean age\u2009=\u20099.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4) while recording 28-channels electroencephalogram, EEG. Some RS participants (n\u2009=\u200910) did not show clear ERP and were excluded from the analysis.\nRESULTS: Major ERP components (here assessed as N1P1 and P2N1 peak-to-peak values) were smaller at SOA 900 than at longer SOAs in both groups, pointing out that the basic mechanism of adaptation in the auditory system is preserved in at least in RS patients with evident ERPs. At the same time the latencies of these components were significantly delayed in the RS than in TD. Moreover, late components (P2N1 and N2P2) were drastically reduced in Rett syndrome irrespective of the SOA, suggesting a largely affected mechanism of integration of upcoming sensory input with memory. Moreover, developmental stagnation of auditory ERP characterized patients with RS: absence of typical P2N1 enlargement and P1 and N1 shortening with age at least for shortest SOA.\nLIMITATIONS: We could not figure out the cause for the high percentage of no-evident ERP RS participants and our final sample of the RS group was rather small. Also, our study did not include a control clinical group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Thus, auditory ERPs inform us about abnormalities within auditory processing that cannot be fully overcomed by slowing presentation rate."

Here, we document the contributions of the early pioneers in Rett syndrome (RTT) research, and describe the evolution of knowledge in terms of diagnostic criteria, clinical variation, and the interplay with other Rett-related disorders. We provide a synthesis of what is known about the neurobiology of MeCP2, considering the lessons learned from both cell and animal models, and how they might inform future clinical trials. With a focus on the core criteria, we examine the relationships between genotype and clinical severity. We review current knowledge about the many comorbidities that occur in RTT, and how genotype may modify their presentation. We also acknowledge the important drivers that are accelerating this research programme, including the roles of research infrastructure, international collaboration and advocacy groups. Finally, we highlight the major milestones since 1966, and what they mean for the day-to-day lives of individuals with RTT and their families."

Eight years ago, the MECP2 gene was associated with the devastating clinical features observed in Rett syndrome patients.\nOBJECTIVES: To investigate the spectrum and the frequency of MECP2 mutations in Serbian Rett syndrome patients.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We screened the MECP2 coding region by conventional mutational screening (single-strand conformation polymorphism/sequencing) in 24 patients of Serbian origin and in their 41 unaffected family members. In search for gene dosage alterations in seemingly mutation-negative girls, we developed a new, specific quantitative PCR method.\nRESULTS: Nineteen patients (79%) carried MECP2 mutations, five of which were novel (one nonsense mutation, one duplication and three deletions). Fourteen previously described disease-causing sequence changes and one polymorphism were also detected. Detailed case reports are given for the carriers of the novel mutations. Large MECP2 rearrangements cause Rett syndrome in a significant number of girls without 'classic' mutations in this gene. Therefore, we developed a specific quantitative PCR method, covering MECP2 exons 3 and 4, which previously has not been used for screening. No dosage alterations of the two exons were found in the four tested mutation-negative girls.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first genetic study of Rett syndrome in Serbian patients describing the MECP2 mutational and phenotypic spectrum in this population. Detailed clinical descriptions of this ethnically homogeneous patient population add to our knowledge of genotype/phenotype correlations in this severe condition."

This protein is essential for the transcription and repression of other genes and is important for the development and plasticity of the central nervous system. Children with Rett syndrome initially develop normally but after a few months their development deteriorates.\nCASE DESCRIPTION: The case describes a girl aged 3 years 7 months whose development had initially been normal but then stagnated and was followed by a phase of regression. Her speech was lost and she developed severe dyspraxia with stereotypic hand movements characteristic of the condition. The clinical diagnosis of Rett syndrome was confirmed through genetic testing. Later on she developed epileptic seizures and a severe scoliosis for which surgical correction and stabilisation was carried out.\nCONCLUSION: Rett syndrome is a severe neurological developmental disorder that occurs almost exclusively in females and for which there is still no causal treatment. The treatment is multidisciplinary and based on clinical experience."

Most females with MECP2 mutations fulfil the established clinical criteria for Rett syndrome, but single cases of asymptomatic carriers have been described. It is therefore likely that there are individuals falling between these two extreme phenotypes.\nOBJECTIVE: To describe three patients showing only minor symptoms of Rett syndrome.\nFINDINGS: The patient with the best intellectual ability had predominantly psychiatric problems with episodes of uncontrolled aggression that have not been described previously in individuals with MECP2 mutations. All three patients had normal hand function, communicated well, and showed short spells of hyperventilation only under stress. Diagnosis in such individuals requires the identification of subtle signs of Rett syndrome in girls with a mild mental handicap. Analysis of the MECP2 gene revealed mutations that are often found in classical Rett syndrome. Skewed X inactivation was present in all three cases, which may explain the mild phenotype.\nCONCLUSIONS: Because of skewed X inactivation, the phenotype of Rett patients may be very mild and hardly recognisable."
