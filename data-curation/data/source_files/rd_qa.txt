1. Disease: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
 Question: Are stress granules involved in the pathogenesis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis?
Ideal Answer: Stress granules are cytoplasmic inclusions that repress translation of a subset of RNAs in times of cellular stress, and several proteins implicated in neurodegeneration (i.e. Ataxin-2 and SMN) interact with stress granules. Mutant FUS proteins that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis incorporate into stress granules. ALS-linked mutations in profilin 1 alter stress granule dynamics, providing further evidence for the potential role of stress granules in ALS pathogenesis. ALS mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism.

2. Disease: Spinal Muscular Atrophy
 Question: Which is the genetic basis of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)?
Ideal Answer: The molecular genetic basis of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder, is the loss of function of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1). Mutations of the SMN1 gene are responsible for SMA. A single nucleotide in the SMN gene regulates splicing and is responsible for spinal muscular atrophy. A critical question is why only the homozygous loss of SMN1, and not SMN2, results in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). H4F5 is also highly deleted in type I SMA chromosomes, and thus is a candidate phenotypic modifier for SMA.

4. Disease: Tuberous Sclerosis
 Question: What is the genetic basis of tuberous sclerosis?
Ideal Answer: The genetic basis of tuberous sclerosis has been attributed to mutations in one of two unlinked genes, TSC1 and TSC2. The functions of the TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, have remained ill defined until recently. Genetic, biochemical, and biologic analyses have highlighted their role as negative regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway. Tuberin, serving as a substrate of AKT and AMPK, mediates mTOR activity by coordinating inputs from growth factors and energy availability in the control of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Emerging evidence also suggests that the TSC 1/2 complex may play a role in modulating the activity of beta-catenin and TGFbeta. These findings provide novel functional links between the TSC genes and other tumor suppressors.

30. Disease: Tuberous Sclerosis
 Question: Is Tuberous Sclerosis a genetic disease?
Ideal Answer: Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, variable expressivity, and incomplete penetrance. Two thirds of TSC cases result from sporadic genetic mutations, not inheritance, but their offspring may inherit it from them. Current genetic tests have difficulty locating the mutation in approximately 20% of individuals diagnosed with the disease. So far it has been mapped to two genetic loci, TSC1 and TSC2.
TSC1 encodes for the protein hamartin, is located on chromosome 9 q34 and was discovered in 1997. TSC2 encodes for the protein Tuberin, is located on chromosome 16 p13.3 and was discovered in 1993. TSC2 is contiguous with PKD1, the gene involved in one form of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Gross deletions affecting both genes may account for the 2% of individuals with TSC who also develop PKD in childhood. TSC2 has been associated with a more severe form of TSC. However, the difference is subtle and cannot be used to identify the mutation clinically. Estimates of the proportion of TSC caused by TSC2 range from 55% to 80-90%.

109. Disease: Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
 Question: What are the types of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome?
Ideal Answer: Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a group of 13 distinct subtypes, each characterized by unique clinical features and inheritance patterns. These subtypes include: , 1. Classical EDS, marked by skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and tissue fragility., 2. Classical-like EDS, with less severe skin involvement than classical EDS., 3. Cardiac-valvular EDS, featuring cardiac valve abnormalities without aortic root enlargement., 4. Vascular EDS, characterized by arterial, intestinal, and uterine fragility, leading to rupture., 5. Hypermobile EDS, the most common type, with joint hypermobility and related symptoms., 6. Arthrochalasia EDS, displaying severe generalized joint hypermobility and congenital hip dislocation., 7. Dermatosparaxis EDS

110. Disease: Cystic Fibrosis
 Question: What are the new treatments for cystic fibrosis?
Ideal Answer: Several new treatments for cystic fibrosis (CF) have been approved or are in development. Here are some notable ones:
- Trikafta (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor): A combination therapy that improves lung function and reduces symptoms in people with the F508del mutation.
- Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor): A combination therapy approved for use in people with the F508del mutation.
- Kalydeco (ivacaftor): A medication approved for use in people with the G551D mutation.
- Symdeko (tezacaftor/ivacaftor): A combination therapy approved for use in people with the F508del mutation.
- Gene therapy: Researchers are working on gene therapies to correct the defective CFTR gene that causes CF.
- RNA-based therapies: These therapies target the defective CFTR gene to restore its function.
- CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing: This technology aims to correct the defective CFTR gene.
- Stem cell therapies: The use of stem cells is being explored to repair or replace damaged lung tissue in people with CF.
- Lung transplantation: This is an option for people with severe CF who have end-stage lung disease.

It's important to note that these treatments are not cures for CF but can help manage symptoms and slow the disease's progression.

111. Disease: Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
 Question: What diseases are included in the differential diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome?
Ideal Answer: The differential diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome includes hypermobility spectrum disorders, Marfan syndrome, Loey-Dietz syndrome, Cutis laxa syndromes, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, osteogenesis Imperfecta Type 1,cfibromyalgia, depression, and chronic fatigue syndrome.

112. Disease: Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
 Question: Is there a specific cure for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome?
Ideal Answer: No. Currently, there is no specific cure for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. Management is focused on treating the various symptoms and complications that can arise from the condition.

113. Disease: Prader-Willi Syndrome
 Question: What is the cause of Prader-Willi Syndrome?
