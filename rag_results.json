            "query": "What is x linked dominant?",
            "gt_answer": "X-linked dominant inheritance is a mode of genetic inheritance      by which a dominant gene is carried on the X chromosome.",
            "response": "X-linked dominant inheritance is a pattern of inheritance in which a dominant gene on the X chromosome is responsible for the development of a condition. In this pattern of inheritance, a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition. This means that a person only needs to inherit one copy of the mutated gene to be affected.\n\nX-linked dominant conditions are caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome. Females, who have two X chromosomes, are more likely to be affected by X-linked dominant conditions than males, who have one X and one Y chromosome. This is because females have two copies of the X chromosome, so even if one copy is mutated, the other copy can still provide a functioning gene. Males, on the other hand, have only one X chromosome, so if it is mutated, they will be affected by the condition.\n\nX-linked dominant conditions can be inherited in the following ways:\n\n* A female with the condition can pass the mutated gene to her sons, who will be affected, and to her daughters, who may be affected or may be carriers of the condition.\n* A male with the condition can pass the mutated gene to his daughters, who may be affected or may be carriers of the condition, but not to his sons, who will not be affected.\n* A female who is a carrier of the condition can pass the mutated gene to her sons, who will be affected, and to her daughters, who may be affected or may be carriers of the condition.\n\nExamples of X-linked dominant conditions include:\n\n* Rett syndrome\n* Fragile X syndrome\n* X-linked ichthyosis\n\nIt's worth noting that X-linked dominant conditions are relatively rare, and most X-linked conditions are recessive, meaning that a person needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to be affected.",

                    "text": "Rett syndrome is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder primarily affecting girls. About 80% of classic Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene for methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCP2) in Xq28. MeCP2 links DNA methylation to transcriptional repression, and MECP2 mutations likely cause partial or complete loss of function of the protein, leading to inappropriate transcription of downstream genes at critical times in brain development. More severe and milder variant forms can all be caused by similar mutations. Most classic Rett syndrome patients have random X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), but skewed patterns are present in a few. All asymptomatic or mildly mentally delayed female carriers studied to date have non-random XCI patterns, suggesting that this attenuates the deleterious effects of the MECP2 mutations in these women. The finding of non-random XCI patterns in some patients with very early truncations is consistent with this observation and supports that many mutations could cause partial and not complete loss of function. Our observation that the mutant mRNA is stable in three patients with truncating mutations supports this possibility. Further studies will have to be performed to better understand the functional consequences of MECP2 mutations in RTT."

                    "text": "Rett syndrome is a severe X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder. Mutations in the MECP2 gene on chromosome Xq28 have been shown to be the cause of Rett syndrome. Sequencing of the MECP2 gene in a patient with clinical suspicion of Rett syndrome revealed c.1160C>T (P387L) in exon 4 of the MECP2 gene homozygously. Females with Rett syndrome are usually heterozygous for a mutation in MECP2. Uniparental disomy as a probable cause for the homozygous presence of this mutation was ruled out by quantitative fluorescence-polymerase chain reaction. Moreover to our knowledge this mutation has only been reported in males with X-linked mental retardation (MRX). We hypothesize that the presence of this mutation c.1160C>T (P387L) in the homozygous form is responsible for the Rett syndrome-like phenotype seen in this patient. This novel report reveals for the first time the homozygous presence of a mutation which has hitherto only been reported in males with MRX."

                    "text": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder affecting almost exclusively girls. It is currently considered a monogenic X-linked dominant disorder due to mutations in MECP2 gene, encoding the methyl-CpG binding protein 2. A few RTT male cases, resulting from mosaicism for MECP2 mutations, have been reported. Male germline MECP2 mutations cause either severe encephalopathy with death at birth (usually in brothers of classical RTT females) or X-linked recessive mental retardation (XLMR). To date the wide phenotypic heterogeneity associated with MECP2 mutations in females (from classical RTT to healthy carriers) has been explained by differences in X chromosome inactivation. However, conflicting results have been obtained in different studies, with both random and highly skewed X-inactivation reported in healthy carrier females. Consequently it is possible that mechanisms other than X-inactivation play a role in the expressivity of MECP2 mutations. To explain the phenotypic heterogeneity associated with MECP2 mutations we propose a digenic model in which the presence of a \"mutated\" allele in a second gene, leading to a less functional protein, determines the clinical severity of the MECP2 mutation. The model is supported by the identification of the same mutation in XLMR and RTT cases. The carrier mothers of XLMR families are clinically asymptomatic and present balanced X chromosome inactivation. Therefore the same mutation arising in different genetic backgrounds can cause XLMR in males, remain silent in the carrier females and cause classic RTT in females. MECP2 mutations account for approximately 70-80% of classic RTT cases. MECP2 negative cases might result from mutations in noncoding regions of MECP2 gene. Alternatively, these cases might be due to mutations in other genes (locus heterogeneity). This hypothesis is supported by the identification of several chromosomal rearrangements in MECP2 negative patients with RTT and RTT-like phenotypes. MeCP2 is considered a general transcriptional"

A number of novel therapies are being developed for muscular dystrophy, and the efficacy of these therapies for heart disease is unknown. The most common X-linked recessive disease is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which arises from defects in the dystrophin gene. Therapy specifically aimed at DMD is reviewed in the context of its projected effect on cardiomyopathy associated with DMD. Additionally, novel therapies are being pursued to treat specifically the cardiomyopathy of DMD. There is substantial genetic heterogeneity underlying the muscular dystrophies, and not all muscular dystrophy patients develop cardiomyopathy. A subset of muscular dystrophies may place patients at significantly greater risk of developing cardiomyopathy and cardiac rhythm disturbances. These disorders are discussed, highlighting recent studies and recommendations for therapy."
