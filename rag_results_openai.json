Identifying the genetic defect in individuals with the disease represents a significant challenge because the gene is extremely large with a high incidence of sporadic mutations across the entire gene ranging from single nucleotide substitutes to large deletions. In the present study, we have used a combination of techniques (heteroduplex analysis, sequencing, loss of heterozygosity and quantification of gene dosage) to define the genetic defect in 68 individuals from a cohort of 107 NF1 Taiwanese patients of Chinese origin. Fifty-eight were initially identified using heteroduplex analytical techniques and confirmed by sequence analysis. A further five were identified by direct sequence analysis alone. The reminders were shown to carry large deletions in the NF1 gene by demonstrating loss of heterozygosity that was confirmed by gene dosage measurements using quantitative-PCR techniques. Mis-sense, non-sense, frame-shift or splice-site mutations were identified across the entire gene of which the majority (45/68) were novel in nature. The detection rate with the various analytical techniques and the types of mutation detected are consistent with published data involving both individuals and large cohort studies from other ethnic backgrounds."

When the limits of resolution for genetic mapping were reached physical mapping methods were used to map the NF1 gene precisely, with reference to translocation breakpoints in NF1 affected individuals who harboured constitutional chromosomal translocations on chromosome 17. The region of DNA located between two translocation breakpoints has been cloned and a DNA sequence encoding a 11-13 kb mRNA identified. That this sequence shows deletions and point mutations in NF1 affected individuals and not in normal controls provides strong evidence that it is indeed the NF1 gene. The genetic defect in NF2 has been mapped to chromosome 22 by studies of chromosomal loss in tumours associated with this disease. Subsequent linkage analysis of NF2 pedigrees has confirmed this location. DNA markers that bracket the NF2 locus to a region of 5-10 Mb have been identified."

The molecular basis of NF1 tumorigenesis is, however, still unclear. Ninety-one tumors from 31 NF1 patients were screened for gross changes in the NF1 gene using microsatellite/restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers; loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was found in 17 out of 91 (19%) tumors (including two out of seven MPNSTs). Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was then used to screen 43 LOH-negative and 10 LOH-positive tumors for NF1 microlesions at both RNA and DNA levels. Thirteen germline and 12 somatic mutations were identified, of which three germline (IVS7-2A>G, 3731delT, 6117delG) and eight somatic (1888delG, 4374-4375delCC, R2129S, 2088delG, 2341del18, IVS27b-5C>T, 4083insT, Q519P) were novel. A mosaic mutation (R2429X) was also identified in a neurofibroma by DHPLC analysis and cloning/sequencing. The observed somatic and germline mutational spectra were similar in terms of mutation type, relative frequency of occurrence, and putative underlying mechanisms of mutagenesis. Tumors lacking mutations were screened for NF1 gene promoter hypermethylation but none were found. Microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis revealed MSI in five out of 11 MPNSTs as compared to none out of 70 neurofibromas (p=1.8 x 10(-5)). The screening of seven MPNSTs for subtle mutations in the CDKN2A and TP53 genes proved negative, although the screening of 11 MPNSTs detected LOH involving either the TP53 or the CDKN2A gene in a total of four tumors. These findings are consistent with the view that NF1 tumorigenesis is a complex multistep process involving a variety of different types of genetic defect at multiple loci."

It is an autosomal-dominant disorder with half of the cases resulting from spontaneous mutations. This genetic defect leads to the formation of benign tumors or neurofibromas of the peripheral nervous system. Dermal neurofibromas may cause local discomfort and itching but are rarely associated with neurological deficit and do not undergo malignant change. The more extensive plexiform neurofibromas produce neurological complications in 27%-43% of patients with NF1 and may undergo malignant degeneration in 5% of cases. Patients with NF1 who develop pain or new neurological symptoms should have a rapid and thorough assessment for malignancy. In this report, we illustrate this point by presenting a patient who developed acute shoulder pain and weakness due to malignant degeneration of a plexiform neurofibroma involving the left brachial plexus, and review the literature on this subject."

Similarities between neurofibromatosis type 1 and Noonan syndrome have been noted for over 20 years and patients who share symptoms of both conditions are often given the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS). The molecular basis of these combined phenotypes was poorly understood and controversially discussed over several decades until the discovery that the syndromes are related through disturbances of the Ras pathway. We present an infant male with coarse facial features, severe supravalvar pulmonic stenosis, automated atrial tachycardia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, airway compression, severe neurological involvement, and multiple complications that lead to death during early infancy. The severity of clinical presentation and significant dysmorphic features suggested the possibility of a double genetic disorder in the Ras pathway instead of NFNS. Molecular analysis showed a missense mutation in exon 25 of the NF1 gene (4288A>G, p.N1430D) and a pathogenic mutation on exon 8 (922A>G, p.N308D) of the PTPN11 gene. Cardiovascular disease has been well described in patients with Noonan syndrome with PTPN11 mutations but the role of haploinsufficiency for neurofibromin in the heart development and function is not yet well understood. Our case suggests that a double genetic defect resulting in the hypersignaling of the Ras pathway may lead to complex cardiovascular abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, refractory arrhythmia, severe neurological phenotype, and early death."

SGs form in response to cellular stress, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is induced in both familial and sporadic forms of ALS. Here we demonstrate that pharmacological induction of ER stress causes TDP-43 to accumulate in the cytoplasm, where TDP-43 also associates with SGs. Furthermore, treatment with salubrinal, an inhibitor of dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2-\u03b1, a key modulator of ER stress, potentiates ER stress-mediated SG formation. Inclusions of C-terminal fragment TDP-43, reminiscent of disease-pathology, form in close association with ER and Golgi compartments, further indicating the involvement of ER dysfunction in TDP-43-associated disease. Consistent with this notion, over-expression of ALS-linked mutant TDP-43, and to a lesser extent wildtype TDP-43, triggers several ER stress pathways in neuroblastoma cells. Similarly, we found an interaction between the ER chaperone protein disulphide isomerase and TDP-43 in transfected cell lysates and in the spinal cords of mutant A315T TDP-43 transgenic mice. This study provides evidence for ER stress as a pathogenic pathway in TDP-43-mediated disease."

A unifying feature of many proteins associated with ALS, including TDP-43 and ataxin-2, is that they localize to stress granules. Unexpectedly, we found that genes that modulate stress granules are strong modifiers of TDP-43 toxicity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster. eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is upregulated by TDP-43 toxicity in flies, and TDP-43 interacts with a central stress granule component, polyA-binding protein (PABP). In human ALS spinal cord neurons, PABP accumulates abnormally, suggesting that prolonged stress granule dysfunction may contribute to pathogenesis. We investigated the efficacy of a small molecule inhibitor of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in ALS models. Treatment with this inhibitor mitigated TDP-43 toxicity in flies and mammalian neurons.

Since only the mutants, but not the endogenous wild-type FUS, are associated with stress granules under most of the stress conditions reported to date, the relationship between FUS and stress granules represents a mutant-specific phenotype and thus may be of significance in mutant-induced pathogenesis. While the association of mutant-FUS with stress granules is well established, the effect of the mutant protein on stress granules has not been examined. Here we investigated the effect of mutant-FUS on stress granule formation and dynamics under conditions of oxidative stress.\nRESULTS: We found that expression of mutant-FUS delays the assembly of stress granules. However, once stress granules containing mutant-FUS are formed, they are more dynamic, larger and more abundant compared to stress granules lacking FUS. Once stress is removed, stress granules disassemble more rapidly in cells expressing mutant-FUS. These effects directly correlate with the degree of mutant-FUS cytoplasmic localization, which is induced by mutations in the nuclear localization signal of the protein. We also determine that the RGG domains within FUS play a key role in its association to stress granules. While there has been speculation that arginine methylation within these RGG domains modulates the incorporation of FUS into stress granules, our results demonstrate that this post-translational modification is not involved.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that mutant-FUS alters the dynamic properties of stress granules, which is consistent with a gain-of-toxic mechanism for mutant-FUS in stress granule assembly and cellular stress response."

Transcriptional SMN2 activation or modulation of its splicing pattern to increase FL-SMN levels is believed to be clinically beneficial and therefore a crucial challenge in SMA research. Drugs such as valproic acid, phenylbutyrate, sodium butyrate, M344 and SAHA that mainly act as histone deacetylase inhibitors can mediate both: they stimulate the SMN2 gene transcription and/or restore the splicing pattern, thereby elevating the levels of FL-SMN2 protein.

The severity of the SMA phenotype is inversely correlated with SMN2 copy number and the level of full-length SMN protein produced by SMN2 ( approximately 10-15% compared with SMN1).

Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups receiving intravenous infusions (mean duration: 25 minutes) every 12 hours of either: placebo and placebo; 2 g ceftriaxone and placebo; or 2 g ceftriaxone twice. Mean steady-state plasma PK variables were: volume of distribution, 14 L (0.17 L/kg); elimination half-life, 8-9 h; total clearance, 17-21 mL/min (0.22-0.25 mL/min/kg). Values were not different between dosage groups. CSF PK analysis, determined through sparse CSF sampling, indicated apparent entry and elimination half-life values of 1.0 and 34 hours, respectively. With both dosage regimens, CSF concentrations were maintained above the target threshold of 1.0 \u00b5M (0.55 \u00b5g/mL) as determined from in vitro models. The plasma and CSF PK profiles of ceftriaxone were used as a basis for planning the Phase 3 clinical trial of ceftriaxone in ALS."

A trial using a novel three stage nonstop design, incorporating Phases I-III, tested ceftriaxone in ALS. Stage 1 determined the cerebrospinal fluid pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone in subjects with ALS. Stage 2 evaluated safety and tolerability for 20-weeks. Analysis of the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety was used to determine the ceftriaxone dosage for Stage 3 efficacy testing.\nMETHODS: In Stage 1, 66 subjects at ten clinical sites were enrolled and randomized equally into three study groups receiving intravenous placebo, ceftriaxone 2 grams daily or ceftriaxone 4 grams daily divided BID. Participants provided serum and cerebrospinal fluid for pharmacokinetic analysis on study day 7. Participants continued their assigned treatment in Stage 2. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed the data after the last participants completed 20 weeks on study drug.\nRESULTS: Stage 1 analysis revealed linear pharmacokinetics, and CSF trough levels for both dosage levels exceeding the pre-specified target trough level of 1 \u00b5M (0.55 \u00b5g/mL). Tolerability (Stages 1 and 2) results showed that ceftriaxone at dosages up to 4 grams/day was well tolerated at 20 weeks. Biliary adverse events were more common with ceftriaxone but not dose-dependent and improved with ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol) therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: The goals of Stages 1 and 2 of the ceftriaxone trial were successfully achieved. Based on the pre-specified decision rules, the DSMB recommended the use of ceftriaxone 4 g/d (divided BID) for Stage 3, which recently closed.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00349622."

The functions of the TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, have remained ill defined until recently. Genetic, biochemical, and biologic analyses have highlighted their role as negative regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway. Tuberin, serving as a substrate of AKT and AMPK, mediates mTOR activity by coordinating inputs from growth factors and energy availability in the control of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Emerging evidence also suggests that the TSC 1/2 complex may play a role in modulating the activity of beta-catenin and TGFbeta. These findings provide novel functional links between the TSC genes and other tumor suppressors.",

This function of Rheb is blocked by rapamycin and dominant-negative mTOR.

Recent studies have demonstrated that TSC2 displays GAP (GTPase-activating protein) activity specifically towards the small G protein Rheb and inhibits its ability to stimulate the mTOR signaling pathway. Rheb and TSC2 comprise a unique pair of GTPase and GAP, because Rheb has high basal GTP levels and TSC2 does not have the catalytic arginine finger found in Ras-GAP. To investigate the function of TSC2 and Rheb in mTOR signaling, we analyzed the TSC2-stimulated Rheb GTPase activity. We found that Arg15, a residue equivalent to Gly12 in Ras, is important for Rheb to function as a substrate for TSC2 GAP. In addition, we identified asparagine residues essential for TSC2 GAP activity. We demonstrated a novel catalytic mechanism of the TSC2 GAP and Rheb that TSC2 uses a catalytic \"asparagine thumb\" instead of the arginine finger found in Ras-GAP. Furthermore, we discovered that farnesylation and membrane localization of Rheb is not essential for Rheb to stimulate S6 kinase (S6K) phosphorylation. Analysis of TSC1 binding defective mutants of TSC2 shows that TSC1 is not required for the TSC2 GAP activity but may function as a regulatory component in the TSC1/TSC2 complex. Our data further demonstrate that GAP activity is essential for the cellular function of TSC2 to inhibit S6K phosphorylation."

We have reported previously that phosphorylation of serine 1210 (Ser(1210)) in TSC2 is essential for 14-3-3 binding. Here we show that serum and anisomycin enhance the interaction between TSC2 and 14-3-3 by stimulating phosphorylation of Ser(1210). Activation of p38 MAP kinase (p38) is essential for the stimulating effect of serum and anisomycin although p38 is not directly responsible for the phosphorylation of Ser(1210) in TSC2. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the p38-activated kinase MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) is directly responsible for the phosphorylation of Ser(1210). Our data show that anisomycin stimulates phosphorylation of Ser(1210) of TSC2 via the p38-MK2 kinase cascade. Phosphorylation of TSC2 by MK2 creates a 14-3-3 binding site and thus regulates the cellular function of the TSC2 tumor suppressor protein."

Easy bruising is, to a variable degree, present in all subtypes of EDS. A variable bleeding tendency, manifesting e.g. as gum bleeding, menometrorraghia, postnatal or peri-operative hemorrhage is observed in many EDS-patients of varying EDS subtypes. Life-threatening arterial aneurysms, dissections and ruptures of medium-sized and large arteries are a hallmark of the vascular subtype of EDS, caused by a molecular defect in collagen type III, an important constituent of blood vessel walls and hollow organs. They may however also occur in other EDS subtypes, especially in classical EDS, caused by defects in type V collagen or, rarely, type I collagen, and in kyphoscoliotic EDS, caused by defects in LH1 or FKBP22. These manifestations of vascular fragility and bleeding are usually attributed to fragility of the blood vessel walls and the perivascular connective tissues, but the molecular pathomechanisms underlying these complications are poorly studied.

In classic Rett syndrome, genotype-phenotype correlation studies suggest that X chromosome inactivation patterns have a more prominent effect on clinical severity than the type of mutation. When the full range of phenotypes associated with MECP2 mutations is considered, however, the mutation type strongly affects disease severity. MeCP2 is a transcriptional repressor that binds to methylated CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome, and mutations in Rett syndrome patients are thought to result in at least a partial loss of function. Abnormal gene expression may thus underlie the phenotype.

Among other functions, MeCP2 binds to methylated genomic DNA, which represents an important epigenetic mark with broad physiological implications, including neuronal development. In this review, we will summarize the genetic foundations behind RTT, and the variable degrees of protein stability exhibited by MeCP2 and its mutated versions. Also, past and emerging relationships that MeCP2 has with mRNA splicing, miRNA processing, and other non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) will be explored, and we suggest that these molecules could be missing links in understanding the epigenetic consequences incurred from genetic ablation of this important chromatin modifier. Importantly, although MeCP2 is highly expressed in the brain, where it has been most extensively studied, the role of this protein and its alterations in other tissues cannot be ignored and will also be discussed. Finally, the additional complexity to RTT pathology introduced by structural and functional implications of the two MeCP2 isoforms (MeCP2-E1 and MeCP2-E2) will be described.

Using this procedure we demonstrated the fusion gene in homozygous form for the first time, in a Macedonian/Ashkenazi Jewish GD type II fetus. Both parents were carriers of the recombination. This was confirmed by direct sequence analysis. A previous conceptus in this family was stillborn at 36 weeks, with features of severe type II GD.

To investigate the molecular basis for this puzzling finding, amplified beta-Glc cDNAs from 6433C homozygous type 2 and type 3 Gaucher disease patients were cloned and sequenced. The Swedish type 3 Gaucher disease patient was truly homozygous for alleles only containing the 6433C mutation. In comparison, the type 2 patient contained a singly mutated 6433C allele and a \"complex\" allele with multiple discrete point mutations (6433C, 6468C, and 6482C). Each of the mutations in the complex allele also was present in the beta-Glc pseudogene. SSO hybridization of 6433C homozygotes revealed that both type 2 patients contained additional mutations in one allele, whereas the 6433C alone was detected in both type 3 and in young severe type 1 Gaucher disease patients. These results suggest that the presence of the complex allele influences the severity of neuronopathic disease in 6433C homozygotes and reveal the central role played by the pseudogene in the formation of mutant alleles of the beta-Glc gene.

Sickle cell disease and \u03b2-thalassemia are common genetic disorders caused by mutations in \u03b2-globin, and we engineered a pair of highly active TALENs that induce modification of 54% of human \u03b2-globin alleles near the site of the sickle mutation. These TALENS stimulate targeted integration of therapeutic, full-length beta-globin cDNA to the endogenous \u03b2-globin locus in 19% of cells prior to selection as quantified by single molecule real-time sequencing. We also developed highly active TALENs to human \u03b3-globin, a pharmacologic target in sickle cell disease therapy. Using the \u03b2-globin and \u03b3-globin TALENs, we generated cell lines that express GFP under the control of the endogenous \u03b2-globin promoter and tdTomato under the control of the endogenous \u03b3-globin promoter. With these fluorescent reporter cell lines, we screened a library of small molecule compounds for their differential effect on the transcriptional activity of the endogenous \u03b2- and \u03b3-globin genes and identified several that preferentially upregulate \u03b3-globin expression."

It is estimated that 4.5% of the population in the world carry \u03b2-Thal mutants (1), posing a persistent threat to public health. The generation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and subsequent correction of the disease-causing mutations offer an ideal therapeutic solution to this problem. However, homologous recombination-based gene correction in human iPSCs remains largely inefficient. Here, we describe a robust process combining efficient generation of integration-free \u03b2-Thal iPSCs from the cells of patients and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-based universal correction of HBB mutations in situ. We generated integration-free and gene-corrected iPSC lines from two patients carrying different types of homozygous mutations and showed that these iPSCs are pluripotent and have normal karyotype. We showed that the correction process did not generate TALEN-induced off targeting mutations by sequencing. More importantly, the gene-corrected \u03b2-Thal iPS cell lines from each patient can be induced to differentiate into hematopoietic progenitor cells and then further to erythroblasts expressing normal \u03b2-globin. Our studies provide an efficient and universal strategy to correct different types of \u03b2-globin mutations in \u03b2-Thal iPSCs for disease modeling and applications."

Cardinal manifestations involve the ocular, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. Ocular findings include myopia (&gt;50% of affected individuals); ectopia lentis (seen in approximately 60% of affected individuals); and an increased risk for retinal detachment, glaucoma, and early cataracts. Skeletal system manifestations include bone overgrowth and joint laxity; disproportionately long extremities for the size of the trunk (dolichostenomelia); overgrowth of the ribs that can push the sternum in (pectus excavatum) or out (pectus carinatum); and scoliosis that ranges from mild to severe and progressive. The major morbidity and early mortality in Marfan syndrome relate to the cardiovascular system and include dilatation of the aorta at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva (predisposing to aortic tear and rupture), mitral valve prolapse with or without regurgitation, tricuspid valve prolapse, and enlargement of the proximal pulmonary artery. Severe and prolonged regurgitation of the mitral and/or aortic valve can predispose to left ventricular dysfunction and occasionally heart failure. With proper management, the life expectancy of someone with Marfan syndrome approximates that of the general population.\nDIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of Marfan syndrome is established in a proband (by definition a person without a known family history of Marfan syndrome) who has an FBN1 pathogenic variant known to be associated with Marfan syndrome and EITHER of the following: Aortic root enlargement (z score \u22652.0).

The diagnosis of MFS is based on the identification of a combination of clinical manifestations in the ocular, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular organ systems defined in the Ghent Nosology (De Paepe et al, 1996). Confirmation of the diagnosis in an individual requires the presence of major clinical manifestations in at least two organ systems associated with involvement of a third organ system. In relatives of an affected proband, major involvement of one organ system and involvement of a second organ system confirms the diagnosis. Major clinical criteria are very specific for MFS and include a combination of (4 out of 8) skeletal manifestations, ectopia lentis, dural ectasia and dilatation or dissection of the ascending aorta. The prevalence of- and the guidelines for the assessment of each of these major criteria are well established. Minor clinical criteria are less typical, but their importance in the diagnostic process should not be underestimated. Unfortunately, figures on the prevalence as well as practical guidelines for the assessment of most minor criteria are lacking, especially for those involving the cardiovascular system. The major cardiovascular manifestation in MFS is a progressive dilatation of the ascending aorta, leading to aortic aneurysm formation and eventually to fatal aortic rupture or dissection. Aortic dissection in early adult life is the leading cause of death in MFS. Early diagnosis of individuals at risk of the disease is extremely important as timely treatment of cardiovascular complications has greatly improved life expectancy in MFS. Despite progress in medical and surgical treatment of aortic aneurysms, MFS continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This may be related to inadequate diagnosis or treatment, but also to the occurrence of cardiovascular problems in ageing MFS patients that were unrecognised until now, such as left ventricular (LV)"

However, functional assay of the acid alpha-D-glucosidase of these patients showed its enzyme function to be defective. In the present study, first we identified a substitution site in four Chinese infantile patients with Pompe disease which is a cytidine to adenosine (C1935-->A) transversion at 5' end of exon 14 causing substitution of glutamic acid for aspartic acid at position 645 of the acid alpha-D-glucosidase. This substitution was introduced in wild-type cDNA and expressed in COS-1 cells. The Asp-645-->Glu substitution resulted in significant reduction of acid alpha-D-glucosidase activity. Second, according to the screening data in 25 Chinese Pompe disease patients using digestion of RT-PCR amplified specific fragment with Aat II, the restriction fragment length analysis showed that patients presented the 861 bp band and the normal individuals presented the 728 bp and 133 bp polymorphic bands. We found that the frequency of mutant allele is 0.8 in infantile patients with Chinese Pompe disease and 0 in normal individuals.

No accumulation of glycogen was found in organs including skeletal muscle in the subject, and thus the residual enzyme activity could protect cells from glycogen storage.

All five of these patients had hypermobile joints, hyperelastic skin, and easy bruising, without atrophic scarring. Tenascin-X mutations were identified in all tenascin-X-deficient patients; one patient had a homozygous tenascin-X gene deletion, one was heterozygous for the deletion, and three others had homozygous truncating point mutations, confirming a causative role for tenascin-X and a recessive pattern of inheritance."

It comprises Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type II, but it is now apparent that these form a continuum of clinical findings and differ only in phenotypic severity. It is currently estimated that approximately 50% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harbor mutations in the COL5A1 and the COL5A2 gene, encoding the \u03b11 and the \u03b12-chain of type V collagen, respectively. However, because no prospective molecular studies of COL5A1 and COL5A2 have been performed in a clinically well-defined patient group, this number may underestimate the real proportion of patients with classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harboring a mutation in one of these genes. In the majority of patients with molecularly characterized classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the disease is caused by a mutation leading to a nonfunctional COL5A1 allele and resulting in haploinsufficiency of type V collagen. A smaller proportion of patients harbor a structural mutation in COL5A1 or COL5A2, causing the production of a functionally defective type V collagen protein. Most mutations identified so far result in a reduced amount of type V collagen in the connective tissues available for collagen fibrillogenesis. Inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variability is observed, but no genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed. No treatment for the underlying defect is presently available for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. However, a series of preventive guidelines are applicable."

An electroencephalogram produced normal results, but magnetic resonance imaging showed a nodular image measuring 1.2 x 1.0 cm close to the Monro foramen, which was similar to cerebral parenchyma and compatible with a subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma. A conservative approach was taken, through control imaging examinations on the lesion for seven years, with absence of any expansive process or neurological symptoms. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a solid, heterogenic and echogenic mass with a calcified focus, measuring 4.6 x 3.4 cm, in the rightkidney, compatible with angiomyolipoma. The patient was treated by means of complete nephrectomy because of malignant areas seen on histopathological examination and died one month after the procedure.

Proof-of-concept has been demonstrated in human dystrophic muscle, with trials in Leiden and London showing that two different oligomer chemistries can restore the reading-frame in selected DMD patients by excising dystrophin exon 51. Systemic delivery of both oligomer types into DMD patients has commenced with promising results but it remains to be established if this therapy will have measurable clinical benefits.

Theoretically, multiple exon skipping could be used to treat approximately 90%, 80%, and 98% of DMD patients with deletion, duplication, and nonsense mutations, respectively. In addition, multiple exon skipping could be used to select deletions that optimize the functionality of the truncated dystrophin protein. The proof of concept of systemic multiple exon skipping using a cocktail of AOs has been demonstrated in dystrophic dog and mouse models. Remaining challenges include the insufficient efficacy of systemic treatment, especially for therapies that target the heart, and limited long-term safety data. Here we review recent preclinical developments in AO-mediated multiple exon skipping and discuss the remaining challenges."

Despite FDA approval of eteplirsen-the first-ever antisense drug clinically marketed for DMD-exon skipping therapy still faces the significant hurdles of limited applicability and unknown truncated protein function. In-frame exon skipping of dystrophin exons 45-55 represents a significant approach to treating DMD, as a large proportion of patients harbor mutations within this \"hotspot\" region. Additionally, patients harboring dystrophin exons 45-55 deletion mutations are reported to have exceptionally mild to asymptomatic phenotypes. Here, we demonstrate that a cocktail of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers can effectively skip dystrophin exons 45-55 in vitro in myotubes transdifferentiated from DMD patient fibroblast cells. This is the first report of substantive exons 45-55 skipping in DMD patient cells. These findings help validate the use of transdifferentiated patient fibroblast cells as a suitable cell model for dystrophin exon skipping assays and further emphasize the feasibility of dystrophin exons 45-55 skipping in patients."

Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping is a promising therapy for DMD. Exon skipping aims to convert out-of-frame mRNA to in-frame mRNA and induce the production of internally-deleted dystrophin as seen in the less severe Becker muscular dystrophy. Currently, multiple exon skipping has gained special interest as a new therapeutic modality for this approach. Previous retrospective database studies represented a potential therapeutic application of multiple exon skipping. Since then, public DMD databases have become more useful with an increase in patient registration and advances in molecular diagnosis. Here, we provide an update on DMD genotype-phenotype associations using a global DMD database and further provide the rationale for multiple exon skipping development, particularly for exons 45\u207b55 skipping and an emerging therapeutic concept, exons 3\u207b9 skipping. Importantly, this review highlights the potential of multiple exon skipping for enabling the production of functionally-corrected dystrophin and for treating symptomatic patients not only with out-of-frame deletions but also those with in-frame deletions. We will also discuss prospects and challenges in multiple exon skipping therapy, referring to recent progress in antisense chemistry and design, as well as disease models."

TSC1 markers showed different maternal and paternal haplotypes in affected children, excluding a mutation in TSC1 as the cause of the disease. For the TSC2 markers all the affected children had the same maternal and paternal haplotypes, as did three of their unaffected siblings. Mutation screening by RT-PCR and direct sequencing of the TSC2 gene identified a 4 bp insertion TACT following nucleotide 2077 in exon 18 which was present in the three affected children but not in five unaffected siblings or the parents. This mutation would cause a frameshift and premature termination at codon 703. Absence of the mutation in lymphocyte DNA from the parents was consistent with germline mosaicism and this was confirmed by our finding of identical chromosome 16 haplotypes in affected and unaffected siblings, providing unequivocal evidence of two different cell lines in the gametes. Molecular analysis of the TSC2 alleles present in the affected subjects showed that the mutation had been inherited from the mother. This is the first case of germline mosaicism in tuberous sclerosis proven by molecular genetic analysis and also the first example of female germline mosaicism for a characterized autosomal dominant gene mutation apparently not associated with somatic mosaicism."

However, no previous reports have used molecular methodology to fully investigate mutations in TSC genes or the possibility of somatic mosaicism. Here, we report a 20-year-old woman with a brain tumor. Pathological diagnosis was consistent with SEGA, but comprehensive clinical screening found no other lesions indicative of TSC. Molecular analysis of the tumor revealed loss of heterozygosity and allelic mutation (5228G>A, R1743Q) of TSC2. To detect the small fraction of mosaic mutation in somatic cells, we developed a highly sensitive new method: triple-nested polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The identical TSC2 missense mutation was not detected in any other tissues from the same patient, including peripheral blood, buccal mucosa, urinary sediment, nail, and hair. According to these results, this patient should be considered as having SEGA that developed from two somatic hit mutations in TSC2, rather than being a TSC2 patient with a very small fraction of somatic mosaicism."

A retrospective review of our patient population that had comprehensive testing for mutations in TSC1/TSC2 identified 23/157 (15%) that were NMI.

It is controversial as to whether these lesion represent a forme fruste of tuberous sclerosis or a distinct entity. The recently reported loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the regions of the TSC1 or TSC2 locus in hamartomas obtained from different organs of patients with established tuberous sclerosis, including cortical tubers, stimulated us to examine epilepsy-associated tuberous sclerosis-like glioneuronal malformations with respect to LOH at the TSC1 and TSC2 loci of chromosomes 9q34 and 16p 13.3, respectively. The analysis was carried out on DNA derived from paraffin-embedded brain tissues of 11 patients. For 5 patients, peripheral blood leukocytes were also available for DNA extraction. We performed microsatellite analysis with five markers on chromosome 9 and four markers on chromosome 16. In addition, polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was performed using a polymorphic EcoRV restriction site in exon 40 of the TSC2 gene. No LOH was identified in any of the cases. These findings do not support a relationship between the epilepsy-associated glioneuronal lesions and tuberous sclerosis. However, tuberous sclerosis is genetically heterogeneous and microsatellite and RFLP analysis cannot exclude small deletions or point mutations. Thus, given the histopathological similarity of glioneuronal malformations in epilepsy patients to cortical tubers, further molecular genetic studies will be needed as our understanding of the molecular basis of tuberous sclerosis increases to completely clarify the relationship of these lesions to tuberous sclerosis."

The incidence of CF in non-Caucasian populations is low. Intensive efforts using genetic linkage information ultimately led to the cloning of the CF gene prior to the identification of the gene product or its function. The gene encodes what is believed to be a transmembrane protein, which has been named the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The CFTR contains two nucleotide-binding folds (NBF) which show homology to numerous transport proteins with the greatest homology to the P-glycoproteins that are encoded by the multiple drug-resistance loci. A three- base deletion resulting in the loss of phenylalanine residue (delta F508) in the tenth exon of the CFTR gene is the mutation occurring on the majority of CF chromosomes. The overall frequency of delta F508 in the present mutant CF gene pool is about 70%, but the study populations are not equally represented: there is marked variation in the population of delta F508 among different geographic populations. Recently, numerous additional, less common mutations have been found. Some mutations occur on 2-5% of the CF chromosomes. Many of these are rare 'private' mutations, occurring in individual families of all racial and ethnic backgrounds. By contrast over 80% of Western European CF mutations have been identified. The highly heterogeneous nature of the remaining CF mutations provides important insights into the structure and function of the protein, but further improvements are needed in DNA-based genetic screening for CF carrier status."

Since their discovery in 1999, over 120 proteins have been described to be localized to these structures (in 154 publications). Most of these components are RNA binding proteins (RBPs) or are involved in RNA metabolism and translation. SGs have been linked to several pathologies including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In ALS and FTD, the majority of cases have no known etiology and exposure to external stress is frequently proposed as a contributor to either disease initiation or the rate of disease progression. Of note, both ALS and FTD are characterized by pathological inclusions, where some well-known SG markers localize with the ALS related proteins TDP-43 and FUS. We propose that TDP-43 and FUS serve as an interface between genetic susceptibility and environmental stress exposure in disease pathogenesis. Here, we will discuss the role of TDP-43 and FUS in SG dynamics and how disease-linked mutations affect this process."

A unifying feature of many proteins associated with ALS, including TDP-43 and ataxin-2, is that they localize to stress granules. Unexpectedly, we found that genes that modulate stress granules are strong modifiers of TDP-43 toxicity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster. eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is upregulated by TDP-43 toxicity in flies, and TDP-43 interacts with a central stress granule component, polyA-binding protein (PABP). In human ALS spinal cord neurons, PABP accumulates abnormally, suggesting that prolonged stress granule dysfunction may contribute to pathogenesis. We investigated the efficacy of a small molecule inhibitor of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in ALS models. Treatment with this inhibitor mitigated TDP-43 toxicity in flies and mammalian neurons. These findings indicate that the dysfunction induced by prolonged stress granule formation might contribute directly to ALS and that compounds that mitigate this process may represent a novel therapeutic approach."

SGs form in response to cellular stress, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is induced in both familial and sporadic forms of ALS. Here we demonstrate that pharmacological induction of ER stress causes TDP-43 to accumulate in the cytoplasm, where TDP-43 also associates with SGs. Furthermore, treatment with salubrinal, an inhibitor of dephosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2-\u03b1, a key modulator of ER stress, potentiates ER stress-mediated SG formation. Inclusions of C-terminal fragment TDP-43, reminiscent of disease-pathology, form in close association with ER and Golgi compartments, further indicating the involvement of ER dysfunction in TDP-43-associated disease. Consistent with this notion, over-expression of ALS-linked mutant TDP-43, and to a lesser extent wildtype TDP-43, triggers several ER stress pathways in neuroblastoma cells. Similarly, we found an interaction between the ER chaperone protein disulphide isomerase and TDP-43 in transfected cell lysates and in the spinal cords of mutant A315T TDP-43 transgenic mice. This study provides evidence for ER stress as a pathogenic pathway in TDP-43-mediated disease."

We found that in response to oxidative stress and to environmental insults of different types TDP-43 is capable to assemble into stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes where protein synthesis is temporarily arrested. We demonstrated that a specific aminoacidic interval (216-315) in the C-terminal region and the RNA-recognition motif 1 domain are both implicated in TDP-43 participation in SGs as their deletion prevented the recruitment of TDP-43 into SGs. Our data show that TDP-43 is a specific component of SGs and not of processing bodies, although we proved that TDP-43 is not necessary for SG formation, and its gene silencing does not impair cell survival during stress. The analysis of spinal cord tissue from ALS patients showed that SG markers are not entrapped in TDP-43 pathological inclusions. Although SGs were not evident in ALS brains, we speculate that an altered control of mRNA translation in stressful conditions may trigger motor neuron degeneration at early stages of the disease."

Hemophilia C (factor XI deficiency) affects both genders and it is usually asymptomatic, manifesting only as postoperative hemorrhage. It is an autosomal recessive, homozygous or heterozygous, disorder, and its severity depends on the levels of factor XI. The objective of this report was to present the anesthetic strategy in a patient with hemophilia C.\nCASE REPORT: This is a 32 years old female, gravida 1/para 0, on the 39th week of pregnancy, scheduled for elective cesarean section. Physical and laboratorial exams did not show any abnormalities. According to the recommendations of the hematologist, on the day of the procedure, the patient was given promethazine, 25 mg, hydrocortisone, 500 mg, due to prior transfusion reaction, and plasma, 10 mL x kg(-1) for a total of 700 mL. Two hours later, the patient underwent subarachnoid block under routine monitoring. Ringer's lactate, 2000 mL, was administered for hydration. The anesthetic-surgical procedure proceeded without intercurrences. Postoperatively, the patient was doing well when, on the 3rd PO day, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 10 mL x kg(-1), was administered to prevent late postoperative bleeding.\nCONCLUSIONS: The objective of this report was to present the anesthetic protocol for patients with hemophilia C and to alert for the need of investigation in patients with a history of postoperative bleeding, when a coagulation study should e be done before any invasive procedure and, in the case of prolonged aPTT, one should investigate the presence of factor XI deficiency."

The effects of chronic amitriptyline treatment on inflammatory markers were studied in the muscle and plasma of mdx mice, and mood-associated monoamine and cytokine concentrations were measured in the amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and midbrain. The mdx mice exhibited increased levels of anxiety and depressive-like behaviour compared with wild-type mice.

The expression of CGT and the synthesis of galactosyl-sphingolipids are associated with the terminal differentiation of OL, but little is known about the participation of endogenous psychosine accumulation in OL differentiation under GALC deficient conditions. In this study, we report that accumulation of endogenous psychosine under GALC deficient Krabbe conditions impedes OL differentiation process both by decreasing the expression of myelin lipids and protein and by inducing the cell death of maturating OLs. The psychosine pathology under GALC deficient conditions involves participation of secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activation and increase in its metabolites, as evidenced by attenuation of psychosine-induced pathology by treatment with pharmacological inhibitor of sPLA2 7,7-dimethyleicosadienoic acid (DEDA).

Our data show that twitcher astrocytes and oligodendrocytes can internalize exogenous GALC, as well as donate the enzyme to the mutant glial cells. Antibodies against human GALC localized the GALC antigen in retrovirally transduced cells and cells receiving enzyme via cell to cell secretion and uptake to the lysosomal fraction. In fact immunocytochemical studies in transduced oligodendrocytes revealed that the GALC colocalizes in vesicles lysosomal-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP2) (+). Moreover, labeling cells with anti-GALC and a marker for oligodendrocytes demonstrated that, upon differentiation, transduced, twitcher oligodendrocytes attained the normal branched process configuration, while untransduced cells show only abnormal morphology. Phenotype correction in mutant oligodendrocytes has also been observed after enzyme transfer.

There was a significant increase in the level of LPC, indicating a phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-dependent pathobiology, in the brains of Krabbe disease patients and those of twitcher mice, an animal model of Krabbe disease. In vitro studies of the treatment of primary oligodendrocytes and the oligodendrocyte MO3.13 cell line with psychosine also showed the generation of LPC and the release of AA in a dose- and time-dependent manner, indicating psychosine-induced activation of PLA2. Studies with various pharmacological inhibitors of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and sPLA2 and psychosine-mediated induction of sPLA2 enzymatic activity in media supernatant suggest that psychosine-induced release of AA and generation of LPC is mainly contributed by sPLA2. An inhibitor of sPLA2, 7,7-dimethyl eicosadienoic acid, completely attenuated the psychosine-mediated accumulation of LPC levels, release of AA, and generation of reactive oxygen species, and blocked oligodendroyte cell death, as evident from cell survival, DNA fragmentation, and caspase 3 activity assays. This study documents for the first time that psychosine-induced cell death is mediated via the sPLA2 signaling pathway and that inhibitors of sPLA2 may hold a therapeutic potential for protection against oligodendrocyte cell death and resulting demyelination in Krabbe disease."

At sites of motor neuron injury, neuroinflammation is a prominent pathological finding and is characterized by microglial activation, astrogliosis, and infiltration of monocytes and T-cells. Both innate and adaptive immune responses actively influence disease progression in animal models and in ALS patients, and promote neuroprotection or neurotoxicity at different stages of disease. The early immune reaction to signals from injured motor neurons is to rescue and repair damaged tissue. As disease accelerates, a shift occurs from beneficial immune responses (involving M2 microglia and regulatory T-cells) to deleterious immune responses (involving M1 microglia and Th1 cells). In this review, we underscore the importance of immune-mediated mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ALS and discuss the alterations and distinct phenotypes of immune cells at the different stages of disease. The better we understand the dynamic changes that occur within the immune system over the course of disease, the better we will be able to develop effective therapeutic regimens in ALS."

Circulating CD4(+) T cells are required for controlling the local detrimental inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases, and for supporting neuronal survival, including that of MN. T-cell deficiency increases neuronal loss, while boosting T cell levels reduces it. Here, we show that in the mutant superoxide dismutase 1 G93A (mSOD1) mouse model of ALS, the levels of natural killer T (NKT) cells increased dramatically, and T-cell distribution was altered both in lymphoid organs and in the spinal cord relative to wild-type mice. The most significant elevation of NKT cells was observed in the liver, concomitant with organ atrophy. Hepatic expression levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 decreased, while the expression of IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-1 was augmented by more than 20-fold in mSOD1 mice relative to wild-type animals. Moreover, hepatic lymphocytes of pre-symptomatic mSOD1 mice were found to secrete significantly higher levels of cytokines when stimulated with an NKT ligand, ex-vivo. Immunomodulation of NKT cells using an analogue of \u03b1-galactosyl ceramide (\u03b1-GalCer), in a specific regimen, diminished the number of these cells in the periphery, and induced recruitment of T cells into the affected spinal cord, leading to a modest but significant prolongation of life span of mSOD1 mice. These results identify NKT cells as potential players in ALS, and the liver as an additional site of major pathology in this disease, thereby emphasizing that ALS is not only a non-cell autonomous, but a non-tissue autonomous disease, as well. Moreover, the results suggest potential new therapeutic targets such as the liver for immunomodulatory intervention for modifying the disease, in addition to MN-based neuroprotection and systemic treatments aimed at reducing oxidative stress."

In this disease, local neuroinflammation develops along the disease course and contributes to its rapid progression. In several models of CNS pathologies, circulating immune cells were shown to display an indispensable role in the resolution of the neuroinflammatory response. The recruitment of such cells to the CNS involves activation of the choroid plexus (CP) of the brain for leukocyte trafficking, through a mechanism that requires IFN-\u03b3 signaling. Here, we found that in the mutant SOD1(G93A) (mSOD1) mouse model of ALS, the CP does not support leukocyte trafficking during disease progression, due to a local reduction in IFN-\u03b3 levels. Therapeutic immunization of mSOD1 mice with a myelin-derived peptide led to CP activation, and was followed by the accumulation of immunoregulatory cells, including IL-10-producing monocyte-derived macrophages and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, and elevation of the neurotrophic factors IGF-1 and GDNF in the diseased spinal cord parenchyma. The immunization resulted in the attenuation of disease progression and an increased life expectancy of the mSOD1 mice. Collectively, our results demonstrate that recruitment of immunoregulatory cells to the diseased spinal cord in ALS, needed for fighting off the pathology, can be enhanced by transiently boosting peripheral immunity to myelin antigens."

We immunomagnetically isolated microglia from different CNS regions of SOD1(G93A) rats at three different points in disease progression: presymptomatic, symptom onset and end-stage. We observed no differences in microglial number or phenotype in presymptomatic rats compared to wild-type controls. Although after disease onset there was no macrophage infiltration, there were significant increases in microglial numbers in the spinal cord, but not cortex. At disease end-stage, microglia were characterized by high expression of galectin-3, osteopontin and VEGF, and concomitant downregulated expression of TNF\u03b1, IL-6, BDNF and arginase-1. Flow cytometry revealed the presence of at least two phenotypically distinct microglial populations in the spinal cord. Immunohistochemistry showed that galectin-3/osteopontin positive microglia were restricted to the ventral horns of the spinal cord, regions with severe motor neuron degeneration. End-stage SOD1(G93A) microglia from the cortex, a less affected region, displayed similar gene expression profiles to microglia from wild-type rats, and displayed normal responses to systemic inflammation induced by LPS. On the other hand, end-stage SOD1(G93A) spinal microglia had blunted responses to systemic LPS suggesting that in addition to their phenotypic changes, they may also be functionally impaired. Thus, after disease onset, microglia acquired unique characteristics that do not conform to typical M1 (inflammatory) or M2 (anti-inflammatory) phenotypes.

In both disorders, these mutations are associated with parent-of-origin specific methylation at several 15q11-q13 loci. The critical PWS region has been narrowed to a approximately 320-kb region between D15S63 and D15S174, encoding several imprinted transcripts, including PAR5, IPW, PAR1 (refs 7,8) and SNRPN, which has so far been considered a strong candidate for the PWS gene.

We have mapped the breakpoint of a balanced translocation (9;15)pat associated with most of the PWS features between SNRPN and IPWIPAR1. Methylation and expression studies indicate that the paternal SNRPN allele is unaffected by the translocation, while IPW and PAR1 are unexpressed.

Mutations in the COL5A1 and COL5A2 genes, which encode type V collagen, have been identified in several individuals. Most mutations affect either the triple-helical domain of the protein or the expression of one COL5A1 allele. We identified a novel splice-acceptor mutation (IVS4-2A-->G) in the N-propeptide-encoding region of COL5A1, in one patient with EDS type I. The outcome of this mutation was complex: In the major product, both exons 5 and 6 were skipped; other products included a small amount in which only exon 5 was skipped and an even smaller amount in which cryptic acceptor sites within exon 5 were used. All products were in frame. Pro-alpha1(V) chains with abnormal N-propeptides were secreted and were incorporated into extracellular matrix, and the mutation resulted in dramatic alterations in collagen fibril structure. The two-exon skip occurred in transcripts in which intron 5 was removed rapidly relative to introns 4 and 6, leaving a large (270 nt) composite exon that can be skipped in its entirety. The transcripts in which only exon 5 was skipped were derived from those in which intron 6 was removed prior to intron 5. The use of cryptic acceptor sites in exon 5 occurred in transcripts in which intron 4 was removed subsequent to introns 5 and 6. These findings suggest that the order of intron removal plays an important role in the outcome of splice-site mutations and provide a model that explains why multiple products derive from a mutation at a single splice site."

Two thirds of TSC cases result from sporadic genetic mutations, not inheritance, but their offspring may inherit it from them. Current genetic tests have difficulty locating the mutation in approximately 20% of individuals diagnosed with the disease. So far it has been mapped to two genetic loci, TSC1 and TSC2.\nTSC1 encodes for the protein hamartin, is located on chromosome 9 q34 and was discovered in 1997. TSC2 encodes for the protein Tuberin, is located on chromosome 16 p13.3 and was discovered in 1993. TSC2 is contiguous with PKD1, the gene involved in one form of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Gross deletions affecting both genes may account for the 2% of individuals with TSC who also develop PKD in childhood. TSC2 has been associated with a more severe form of TSC. However, the difference is subtle and cannot be used to identify the mutation clinically. Estimates of the proportion of TSC caused by TSC2 range from 55% to 80-90%.",

TSC was recognized to be a genetic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance in the early twentieth century. The prevalence in the general population is at least 1 in 10,000 with two-thirds of cases occurring sporadically and one-third of cases being familial. The disease exhibits variable expression which may cause mildly affected individuals to be undiagnosed. Because the aberrant or missing proteins which result in TSC have eluded investigators, a positional cloning approach has been pursued to find the mutated genes. Genetic linkages have been reported to chromosomes 9, 11, and 12. There is definite evidence for a TSC-causing locus on chromosome 9 which is thought to account for between one-third and one-half of all familial cases. Investigators have narrowed the location on chromosome 9 to approximately two megabases of physical distance. There is some evidence for a locus on chromosome 11 which probably accounts only for a small percentage of familial cases. The locus proposed on chromosome 12 was reported by a single group and has not been confirmed by other research groups. Evidence for genetic heterogeneity is abundant. There is definitely a TSC-causing locus on chromosome 9q (TSC-1) and there is at least one additional locus, maybe more than one. As the molecular basis of TSC unfolds, new insight will be gained about the protean nature of the disorder and the genetic heterogeneity."

Anthropometric measurements and musculoskeletal abnormalities were determined in a standardized fashion: pectus and scoliosis were assessed through radiography and angulation (\u00e2) of the scoliosis curve using the Cobb method; arachnodactyly was assessed through the thumb sign and Walker-Murdoch test and dolichostenomelia was assessed by arm span in relation to height. Patients also responded to a questionnaire addressing participation in physical therapy.\nRESULTS: In comparison to values estimated for the Brazilian population, mass and height were greater among the patients with MS (females: p=0.001 e p<0.0005 e males p=0.019 e p=0.0001, respectively). The following musculoskeletal abnormalities were found: pectus in 3 patients (11%), pectus and scoliosis in 19 (73%), dolichostenomelia in 11 (42%) and arachnodactyly in 21 (80%). Eleven patients (42%) with MS had previously undergone physical therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS exhibit altered musculoskeleto and anthropometry and have infrequent physical therapy treatment."

Ashkenazi Jewish patients with classic Tay-Sachs disease have appeared to be clinically and biochemically identical, and the usual assumption has been that they harbor the same alpha-chain mutation. In this study I have isolated the alpha-chain gene from an Ashkenazi Jewish patient, GM2968, with classic Tay-Sachs disease and compared its nucleotide sequences with that of the normal alpha-chain gene in the promoter region, exon and splice junction regions, and polyadenylylation signal area. Only one difference was observed between these sequences: at the 5' boundary of intron 12, a guanosine in the conserved splice junction dinucleotide sequence G-T had been altered to a cytidine. The alteration is presumed to be functionally significant and to result in aberrant mRNA splicing. Utilizing the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the region encompassing the mutation, I developed an assay to screen patients and heterozygote carriers for this mutation. Surprisingly, in each of two Ashkenazi patients, only one alpha-chain allele harbored the splice junction mutation. Only one parent of each of these patients was positive for the defect. Another Ashkenazi patient did not bear this mutation at all nor did either of the subject's parents. In addition, 30% of obligate heterozygotes tested carried the splice junction mutation, whereas 20 Ashkenazi Jews designated noncarriers by enzymatic assay were negative for this alteration.

Circulating CD4(+) T cells are required for controlling the local detrimental inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases, and for supporting neuronal survival, including that of MN. T-cell deficiency increases neuronal loss, while boosting T cell levels reduces it. Here, we show that in the mutant superoxide dismutase 1 G93A (mSOD1) mouse model of ALS, the levels of natural killer T (NKT) cells increased dramatically, and T-cell distribution was altered both in lymphoid organs and in the spinal cord relative to wild-type mice. The most significant elevation of NKT cells was observed in the liver, concomitant with organ atrophy. Hepatic expression levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 decreased, while the expression of IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-1 was augmented by more than 20-fold in mSOD1 mice relative to wild-type animals. Moreover, hepatic lymphocytes of pre-symptomatic mSOD1 mice were found to secrete significantly higher levels of cytokines when stimulated with an NKT ligand, ex-vivo. Immunomodulation of NKT cells using an analogue of \u03b1-galactosyl ceramide (\u03b1-GalCer), in a specific regimen, diminished the number of these cells in the periphery, and induced recruitment of T cells into the affected spinal cord, leading to a modest but significant prolongation of life span of mSOD1 mice. These results identify NKT cells as potential players in ALS, and the liver as an additional site of major pathology in this disease, thereby emphasizing that ALS is not only a non-cell autonomous, but a non-tissue autonomous disease, as well. Moreover, the results suggest potential new therapeutic targets such as the liver for immunomodulatory intervention for modifying the disease, in addition to MN-based neuroprotection and systemic treatments aimed at reducing oxidative stress."

At sites of motor neuron injury, neuroinflammation is a prominent pathological finding and is characterized by microglial activation, astrogliosis, and infiltration of monocytes and T-cells. Both innate and adaptive immune responses actively influence disease progression in animal models and in ALS patients, and promote neuroprotection or neurotoxicity at different stages of disease. The early immune reaction to signals from injured motor neurons is to rescue and repair damaged tissue. As disease accelerates, a shift occurs from beneficial immune responses (involving M2 microglia and regulatory T-cells) to deleterious immune responses (involving M1 microglia and Th1 cells). In this review, we underscore the importance of immune-mediated mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ALS and discuss the alterations and distinct phenotypes of immune cells at the different stages of disease. The better we understand the dynamic changes that occur within the immune system over the course of disease, the better we will be able to develop effective therapeutic regimens in ALS."

Its cause is unknown and it is uniformly fatal, typically within five years. About 10% of cases are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, with high penetrance after the sixth decade. In most instances, sporadic and autosomal dominant familial ALS (FALS) are clinically similar. We have previously shown that in some but not all FALS pedigrees the disease is linked to a genetic defect on chromosome 21q (refs 8, 9). Here we report tight genetic linkage between FALS and a gene that encodes a cytosolic, Cu/Zn-binding superoxide dismutase (SOD1), a homodimeric metalloenzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of the toxic superoxide anion O2.- to O2 and H2O2 (ref. 10). Given this linkage and the potential role of free radical toxicity in other neurodenegerative disorders, we investigated SOD1 as a candidate gene in FALS. We identified 11 different SOD1 missense mutations in 13 different FALS families."

The cause of disease is unknown other than in the rare cases of familial disease arising from mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 gene. Many theories for pathogenesis have been proposed - including oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction and abnormal protein aggregation - based on studies of human post mortem tissue, research on animal models, and in vitro work. Here we review the evidence for the main pathogenic mechanisms and outline how they might interact to cause motor neuron death. Clinical trials have as yet failed to identify any truly effective therapies in ALS, with only riluzole providing a modest improvement in survival. Ongoing trials are exploring the value of antiglutamatergic agents, including the cephalosporin antibiotic ceftriaxone, as well as antioxidants, mitochondrial enhancers and anti-apoptotic drugs. It is likely that effective therapy will involve combinations of agents acting on different mechanisms. Gene therapy with neurotrophic factors will soon be in clinical trials, while work on stem cell therapy remains preclinical. In addition to finding effective therapies, research also needs to identify early disease markers because therapy is likely to be of most benefit when given early in the course of disease."

Abnormalities in glutamate metabolism have led to the excitotoxin hypothesis of MN destruction. Other theories include deficits in MN trophic factors, trans-synaptic degeneration, impaired ability to detoxify putative toxic agents and impaired DNA/RNA metabolism. The existence of familial forms, some of which show linkage to markers in chromosome 21, allows a genetic approach to the mechanisms of disease. Recent studies suggest that mutations in the Cu/Zn SOD gene may be important in some of the familial forms.

A biomarker with both high sensitivity and specificity for accurate prediction is preferred. Until now creatine kinase (CK) levels have been used for DMD diagnosis but these fail to assess disease progression.

We explored this hypothesis by evaluating the extent of gene deletions in three multigenerational families with spinal muscular atrophy exhibiting dramatic intrafamilial phenotypic variation. Using somatic cell hybrid lines to sequester individual spinal muscular atrophy homologues, we show that homologues missing several contiguous genes correlate with \"severe\" disease alleles and homologues missing only SMNT correlate with \"mild\" disease alleles.

Diagnosis of both, acute myocardial infarction and beta-thalassaemia trait, was based on the standard clinical and laboratory criteria.

Patients with \u03b2-thalassemia show weak genotype-phenotype correlations. Mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms are a potential source for different physiological and pathological characteristics and have been found to be associated as genetic modifiers with various pathophysiologies, including cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. A group of 35 patients with \u03b2-thalassemia was investigated for the presence of mtDNA D-loop polymorphisms in comparison with 504 normal controls. We found four mtDNA D-loop polymorphisms at nucleotides 16,069C\u2009>\u2009T, 16,189T\u2009>\u2009C, 16,319G\u2009>\u2009A, and 16,519T\u2009>\u2009C that showed significant differences between patients and normal subjects. There is no strong proof for the association of these polymorphisms with \u03b2-thalassemia. It is hypothesized that iron overload or its effects on sequestration of calcium or zinc can lead to oxidative stress and ROS production inside the mitochondria. Therefore, possible accompanying of mtDNA polymorphisms with \u03b2-thalassemia disease may complicate the genotype-phenotype correlation and could affect the clinical outcomes in the patients."

The currently approved, biologics-based therapy for Fabry disease is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with either agalsidase alfa (Replagal) or agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme). Based on preclinical data, migalastat HCl in combination with agalsidase is expected to result in the pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancement of agalsidase in plasma by increasing the systemic exposure of active agalsidase, thereby leading to increased cellular levels in disease-relevant tissues. This Phase 2a study design consisted of an open-label, fixed-treatment sequence that evaluated the effects of single oral doses of 150 mg or 450 mg migalastat HCl on the PK and tissue levels of intravenously infused agalsidase (0.2, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg) in male Fabry patients. As expected, intravenous administration of agalsidase alone resulted in increased \u03b1-Gal A activity in plasma, skin, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) compared to baseline. Following co-administration of migalastat HCl and agalsidase, \u03b1-Gal A activity in plasma was further significantly increased 1.2- to 5.1-fold compared to agalsidase administration alone, in 22 of 23 patients (95.6%). Importantly, similar increases in skin and PBMC \u03b1-Gal A activity were seen following co-administration of migalastat HCl and agalsidase. The effects were not related to the administered migalastat HCl dose, as the 150 mg dose of migalastat HCl increased \u03b1-Gal A activity to the same extent as the 450 mg dose. Conversely, agalsidase had no effect on the plasma PK of migalastat. No migalastat HCl-related adverse events or drug-related tolerability issues were identified.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01196871."

At multiple time points, \u03b1-Gal A activity and GL-3 levels were quantified in blood cells, kidney and skin.

The same 6 patients who demonstrated increases of \u03b1-Gal A activity also had GL-3 reduction in skin, urine and/or kidney, and had \u03b1-Gal A mutations that responded in transfected cells incubated with the drug.

As a result, micro-vascular occlusion arises which may lead to serious, sometimes fatal, crises. The present article reviews the historical, genetic, molecular, cellular, and clinical aspects of the disease. A review for the development and design of drugs to treat sickle cell anemia is presented. Anti-sickling agents are classified, based on the target to be modified, into three classes: the gene, the sickle hemoglobin molecule, and the red cell membrane modifiers. In spite of the full understanding of the pathology, physiology, and the molecular nature of the disease, and the development of large number of antisickling agents, a cure for sickle cell anemia still is unavailable. Strategies to treat sickle cell anemia since the early times of the disease state discovery in 1910, has focussed mainly on prophylactic measures to alleviate the painful crises. The article addresses clinical approaches used then and now to treat the disease, and the rationale of their use. Currently in clinical practice, hydroxyurea is the most commonly used agent to treat the disease, and it has been recently approved by the united states Food and Drug Administration as a drug for that purpose."

Based on its interaction with multiple molecular partners and the diverse epigenetic scenario, MeCP2 triggers several downstream mechanisms, also influencing the epigenetic context, and thus leading to transcriptional activation or repression.

In classic Rett syndrome, genotype-phenotype correlation studies suggest that X chromosome inactivation patterns have a more prominent effect on clinical severity than the type of mutation. When the full range of phenotypes associated with MECP2 mutations is considered, however, the mutation type strongly affects disease severity. MeCP2 is a transcriptional repressor that binds to methylated CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome, and mutations in Rett syndrome patients are thought to result in at least a partial loss of function.

RTT is caused by heterozygosity for mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2, which encodes methyl-CpG binding protein 2. MeCP2 is a multifunctional protein that can act as an architectural chromatin-binding protein, a function that is unrelated to its ability to bind methyl-CpG and to attract chromatin modification complexes. Inactivating mutations that cause RTT in females are not prenatally lethal in males, but lead to profound congenital encephalopathy. Molecular diagnoses of RTT, through demonstration of a MECP2 mutation, made at an early stage of the disorder, usually confirm the sporadic nature and very low recurrence risk of the condition. A positive DNA test result, however, also predicts the inevitable clinical course, given the lack of effective intervention. Initial hypotheses indicating that the MeCP2 protein acts as a genome-wide transcriptional repressor were not confirmed by global gene expression studies in various tissues of individuals with RTT and mouse models of MeCP2 deficiency. Rather, recent evidence points to low-magnitude effects of a small number of genes--including the brain--derived neurotrophic factor pathway and glucocorticoid response genes-that might affect formation and maturation of synapses or synaptic function in postmitotic neurons."

Study design was a retrospective review of records collected over a 15-year period, the setting was an international referral laboratory for the study of metabolic disease, and the subjects were all known cases of ALD diagnosed in Australia and New Zealand between 1981 and 1996 and their families. We estimate that the combined incidence of ALD and its variants in Australasia is at least 1.6 per 100,000. Of 95 affected males, 51 had cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, 24 had adrenomyeloneuropathy, 15 had Addison's disease only, and 5 remained asymptomatic when last examined. However, the distribution of phenotypes among newly diagnosed patients has changed substantially over the last 15 years, with cerebral forms of the disease forming a decreasing proportion of new diagnoses. The measurement of plasma very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) alone detects 93% of women who can be proven to be carriers. The addition of genetic linkage studies or assay of VLCFAs in cultured fibroblasts improved this detection rate to the point that there were no obligate carriers who could not be detected using a combination of two or more techniques."

This study investigates disease incidence within an Australian model of cascade screening and evolving genetic diagnostic technologies. A retrospective population-based cohort study of all genetically and/or histopathologically confirmed males with DMD, born in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory was undertaken from 2002-2012. Cases were identified using state-wide molecular laboratory and clinical databases. The annual disease incidence and \"theoretically\" preventable cases were extrapolated over the study period. Proband genotype/phenotype, pedigree analysis, carrier-risk and extent of cascade screening were also determined. The cumulative incidence of disease was 19.7 per 100,000 male live births and 1 in 5076 live born males were diagnosed with DMD. Differences in disease incidence were not statistically different when compared between 2002-2007 and 2008-2012 (incidence rate ratio\u2009=\u20091.13, 95% CI 0.76-1.69, p\u2009=\u20090.52). The incidence rate ratio of theoretically preventable cases did not significantly change between 2002-2007 and 2008-2012 (incidence rate ratio\u2009=\u20092.07, 95% CI 0.58-9.21, p\u2009=\u20090.23). Current diagnostic and cascade screening models have limitations in their impact on disease incidence, due to a spectrum of logistical, patient and condition related factors. Innovative approaches to reduce DMD incidence may be better achieved by preconception or early pregnancy carrier screening, prenatal exome sequencing and newborn screening."

At present, the standard treatment for Fabry disease is enzyme replacement therapy, and in order to overcome the problems involved with this, a method of producing recombinant human \u03b1-Gal A using methanol-assimilating yeast, and chemical or medicinal chaperone treatment are of current interest.

Easy bruising is, to a variable degree, present in all subtypes of EDS. A variable bleeding tendency, manifesting e.g. as gum bleeding, menometrorraghia, postnatal or peri-operative hemorrhage is observed in many EDS-patients of varying EDS subtypes. Life-threatening arterial aneurysms, dissections and ruptures of medium-sized and large arteries are a hallmark of the vascular subtype of EDS, caused by a molecular defect in collagen type III, an important constituent of blood vessel walls and hollow organs. They may however also occur in other EDS subtypes, especially in classical EDS, caused by defects in type V collagen or, rarely, type I collagen, and in kyphoscoliotic EDS, caused by defects in LH1 or FKBP22. These manifestations of vascular fragility and bleeding are usually attributed to fragility of the blood vessel walls and the perivascular connective tissues, but the molecular pathomechanisms underlying these complications are poorly studied. This review summarizes current knowledge on manifestations of vascular fragility in the different EDS subtypes."

These types are caused by variants in 20 different genes, the majority of which encode the fibrillar collagen types I, III and V, modifying or processing enzymes for those proteins, and enzymes that can modify glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans. For the hypermobile type of EDS, the molecular underpinnings remain unknown. As connective tissue is ubiquitously distributed throughout the body, manifestations of the different types of EDS are present, to varying degrees, in virtually every organ system. This can make these disorders particularly challenging to diagnose and manage.

The 2017 International Classification of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and related disorders identifies 13 clinical types due to deleterious variants in 19 different genes. Recent publications point out the possibility of a wider spectrum of conditions that may be considered members of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome community. Most Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are due to inherited abnormalities affecting the biogenesis of fibrillar collagens and other components of the extracellular matrix. The introduction of next-generation sequencing technologies in the diagnostic setting fastened patients' classification and improved our knowledge on the phenotypic variability of many Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. This is impacting significantly patients' management and family counseling. At the same time, most individuals presenting with joint hypermobility and associated musculoskeletal manifestations still remain without a firm diagnosis, due to a too vague clinical presentation and/or the lack of an identifiable molecular biomarker. These individuals are currently defined with the term \"hypermobility spectrum disorders\". Hence, in parallel with a continuous update of the International Classification of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, the scientific community is investing efforts in offering a more efficient framework for classifying and, hopefully, managing individuals with joint hypermobility."

Over and above these common features, they differ in the presence or absence of various organ and tissue abnormalities, and differences in genetic causal mechanisms and degree of severity. They are complex and multisystem diseases, with the majority being highly disabling because of major joint problems and neurosensory deficiencies, and in some cases, they may be life-threatening due to associated complications, especially vascular disorders. In 1997, the Villefranche classification defined 6\u00a0subtypes of EDS. However, many other new variants have been described over the last years. The \"historical\" EDS were characterized by abnormalities in fibrillar collagen protein synthesis. More recently, disorders of synthesis and organization of the extracellular matrix have been shown to be responsible for other types of EDS. Thus, many EDS are in fact metabolic diseases related to enzymatic defects. While there is no curative treatment for any type of EDS, early diagnosis is of utmost importance in order to optimize the symptomatic management of patients and to prevent avoidable complications. Patients must be treated and monitored by multidisciplinary teams in highly specialized reference centers.

The first proband was heterozygous for a 7 bp deletion that resulted in skipping of exon 27 while the second proband was heterozygous for a single nucleotide substitution that resulted in skipping of exon 28. Cultured dermal fibroblasts from both probands produced about equal amounts of the normal and mutant alpha2(V) mRNAs and protein chains. The dermis from the first proband contained a sparse collagen fibrillar network with great variability in collagen fibril sizes and shapes. The dermal collagens were also abnormally soluble. Bone cells from the first proband also produced about equal amounts of the normal and mutant alpha2(V) mRNAs. However, the collagen fibrillar architecture and collagen solubility of the bone matrix were normal.

Fibrillin-1 mutations have also been found in patients who do not fulfil clinical criteria for the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, but have related disorders of connective tissue, such as isolated ectopia lentis, familial aortic aneurysm, and Marfan-like skeletal abnormalities, so that Marfan syndrome may be regarded as one of a range of type 1 fibrillinopathies.

However, a clustering of mutations associated with the most severe form of Marfan syndrome, neonatal Marfan syndrome, has been noted in a region encompassing exons 24 to 32. The gene for fibrillin-2 (FBN2) is highly homologous to FBN1, and mutations in FBN2 have been shown to cause a phenotypically related disorder termed congenital contractural arachnodactyly.

The generation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and subsequent correction of the disease-causing mutations offer an ideal therapeutic solution to this problem. However, homologous recombination-based gene correction in human iPSCs remains largely inefficient. Here, we describe a robust process combining efficient generation of integration-free \u03b2-Thal iPSCs from the cells of patients and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-based universal correction of HBB mutations in situ. We generated integration-free and gene-corrected iPSC lines from two patients carrying different types of homozygous mutations and showed that these iPSCs are pluripotent and have normal karyotype. We showed that the correction process did not generate TALEN-induced off targeting mutations by sequencing. More importantly, the gene-corrected \u03b2-Thal iPS cell lines from each patient can be induced to differentiate into hematopoietic progenitor cells and then further to erythroblasts expressing normal \u03b2-globin. Our studies provide an efficient and universal strategy to correct different types of \u03b2-globin mutations in \u03b2-Thal iPSCs for disease modeling and applications."

The A gamma T chain was observed on seven chromosomes and about 5% of the analyzed beta S chromosomes exhibited atypical haplotypes. The common haplotype beta C was found in all patients with SC disease. An interesting feature was the high frequency (44%) of deletional alpha-thalassemia among SS patients. Two patients have an alpha-gene globin triplication. The DNA haplotypes and alpha-gene status have been correlated with hematological parameters in these patients.

Active L1 retrotransposons can impact the genome in a variety of ways, creating insertions, deletions, new splice sites or gene expression fine-tuning. We have shown previously that L1 retrotransposons are capable of mobilization in neuronal progenitor cells from rodents and humans and evidence of massive L1 insertions was observed in adult brain tissues but not in other somatic tissues. In addition, L1 mobility in the adult hippocampus can be influenced by the environment. The neuronal specificity of somatic L1 retrotransposition in neural progenitors is partially due to the transition of a Sox2/HDAC1 repressor complex to a Wnt-mediated T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) transcriptional activator. The transcriptional switch accompanies chromatin remodelling during neuronal differentiation, allowing a transient stimulation of L1 transcription. The activity of L1 retrotransposons during brain development can have an impact on gene expression and neuronal function, thereby increasing brain-specific genetic mosaicism. Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate L1 expression should provide new insights into the role of L1 retrotransposition during brain development. Here we show that L1 neuronal transcription and retrotransposition in rodents are increased in the absence of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a protein involved in global DNA methylation and human neurodevelopmental diseases. Using neuronal progenitor cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells and human tissues, we revealed that patients with Rett syndrome (RTT), carrying MeCP2 mutations, have increased susceptibility for L1 retrotransposition. Our data demonstrate that L1 retrotransposition can be controlled in a tissue-specific manner and that disease-related genetic mutations can influence the frequency of neuronal L1 retrotransposition.

Mutation analysis of the MECP2 gene identified a de novo MECP2 mutation, L100V. Examination of a panel of X-linked microsatellite markers indicated that her supernumerary X chromosome is maternally derived. X-inactivation patterns were determined by analysis of methylation of the androgen receptor locus, and indicated preferential inactivation of her paternal allele. The parental origin of her MECP2 mutation could not be determined because she was uninformative for intronic polymorphisms flanking her mutation. This is the first reported case of sex chromosome trisomy and MECP2 mutation in a female, and it illustrates the importance of allele dosage on the severity of Rett syndrome phenotype."

About 80% of classic Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene for methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCP2) in Xq28. MeCP2 links DNA methylation to transcriptional repression, and MECP2 mutations likely cause partial or complete loss of function of the protein, leading to inappropriate transcription of downstream genes at critical times in brain development. More severe and milder variant forms can all be caused by similar mutations. Most classic Rett syndrome patients have random X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), but skewed patterns are present in a few. All asymptomatic or mildly mentally delayed female carriers studied to date have non-random XCI patterns, suggesting that this attenuates the deleterious effects of the MECP2 mutations in these women. The finding of non-random XCI patterns in some patients with very early truncations is consistent with this observation and supports that many mutations could cause partial and not complete loss of function. Our observation that the mutant mRNA is stable in three patients with truncating mutations supports this possibility. Further studies will have to be performed to better understand the functional consequences of MECP2 mutations in RTT."

Patients show a normal neonatal period with subsequent developmental regression and a loss of acquired skills (communication and motor skills), deceleration of head growth, and development of typical hand stereotypies. Recent studies have shown that mutations in the X-linked methyl CpG binding protein 2 gene (MeCP2) cause most typical cases of Rett syndrome. The MeCP2 gene encodes a protein that binds methylated cytosine residues of CpG dinucleotides and mediates, with histone deacetylases and transcriptional repressors, the transcription \"silencing\" of other genes. Girls with Rett syndrome exhibit mosaic expression for the MeCP2 defect at the cellular level, with most patients showing random X-inactivation and approximately equal numbers of cells expressing the normal MeCP2 gene and the mutated MeCP2 gene. In rare cases, females with a MeCP2 mutation escape phenotypic expression of the disorder because of nonrandom X-inactivation and the preferential inactivation of the mutated MeCP2 allele. Nonrandom patterns of X-inactivation may also contribute to the clinical variability often seen in girls with Rett syndrome. The spectrum of clinical phenotype caused by MeCP2 mutations is wide, including milder \"preserved speech\" variants, the severe congenital Rett variant, and a subset of X-linked recessive mental retardation in boys. Studies have shown that atypical and classical Rett syndrome can caused by the same MeCP2 mutations, indicating clinical phenotype is variable even among girls with the same MeCP2 mutation. The relationship between type of MeCP2 mutation, X-inactivation status, and clinical phenotype of Rett syndrome is complex and likely involves other environmental and polygenic modifiers."

It has been well established that mutations in the FBN1 gene encoding the structural protein Fibrillin 1 is the molecular etiology of Marfan syndrome. However, there are numerous patients who meet the Ghent clinical diagnostic criteria for Marfan syndrome who do not have identifiable FBN1 mutations.

Individuals with this Marfanoid disorder lack the ocular findings of Marfan syndrome and often have dysmorphic features such as unusual facies, cleft palate, and contractures. In addition, Loeys-Dietz syndrome patients often present in childhood with significant cardiovascular problems.

The excellent results of this pilot study engendered considerable optimism among patients, their families, patients' associations, and the scientific community.

Many patients who were not included in these studies used all resources at their disposal to access the drug as treatment under a compassionate use programme.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of lithium in ALS using a meta-analysis of the information reported in 12 studies which were examined for methodological quality.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: . Searches were performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and EudraCT (January 1996-August 2012).\nRESULTS: To date, we have information on more 1100 patients treated with lithium. Unfortunately, the results do not confirm the positive effect described in the pilot study, which suggests that this drug is not effective at slowing disease progression. Two trials had to be suspended before the scheduled completion date due to the ineffectiveness of the drug as well as numerous adverse effects. A recently published study also ruled out any possible modest effect.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to suggest that lithium has no short-term benefits in ALS. A comparison of the group of patients treated with lithium+riluzole and the control group treated with riluzole alone showed no statistically significant differences in rates of functional decline, deterioration of respiratory function, or survival time.

Patients with clinically probable or definite ALS of more than 6 months and less than 5 years duration were randomly assigned to placebo, 1 mg or 2 mg xaliproden orally once daily as monotherapy in Study 1 (n=867); or to the same regimen with addition of riluzole 50 mg bid background therapy in Study 2 (n=1210 patients). The two primary endpoints were defined as: 1. Time to death, tracheostomy, or permanent assisted ventilation (DTP), and 2. Time to vital capacity (VC)<50% or DTP before (log-rank test) and after adjustment using a Cox proportional hazard model for prespecified prognostic factors. Secondary endpoints were rates of change of various functional measures. In Study 1, primary outcome measures did not reach statistical significance. For the 2 mg group, for time to VC<50% analysis (without DTP) a significant 30% RRR was obtained (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.46, P=0.009). In Study 2, no significant results were obtained. However, there was a trend in favour of add-on 1 mg dose xaliproden vs. placebo (RRR 15% [-6.31, ns] for time to VC<50%; RRR 12% [CI: -6.27, ns] for time to VC<50% or DTP). Adjusted RR ratios were consistently more favourable for the xaliproden groups. Tolerability was good, and dose-dependent side effects were largely associated with the serotonergic properties of xaliproden. An effect of xaliproden on functional parameters, especially VC, was noted. Although this effect did not reach statistical significance, xaliproden had a small effect on clinically noteworthy aspects of disease progression in ALS."

The six months intent-to-treat analysis showed no statistically significant effect but a trend in favour of 2 mg xaliproden compared to placebo for reduction in the rate of deterioration of FVC, limbs functional score, and manual muscle testing score (MMT).

The combinations of minocycline-creatine and celecoxib-creatine have additive effects in the murine model. New trial designs are needed to efficiently screen the growing number of potential neuroprotective agents. Our objective was to assess two drug combinations in ALS using a novel phase II trial design. We conducted a randomized, double-blind selection trial in sequential pools of 60 patients. Participants received minocycline (100 mg)-creatine (10 g) twice daily or celecoxib (400 mg)-creatine (10 g) twice daily for six months. The primary objective was treatment selection based on which combination best slowed deterioration in the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R); the trial could be stopped after one pool if the difference between the two arms was adequately large. At trial conclusion, each arm was compared to a historical control group in a futility analysis. Safety measures were also examined. After the first patient pool, the mean six-month decline in ALSFRS-R was 5.27 (SD=5.54) in the celecoxib-creatine group and 6.47 (SD=9.14) in the minocycline-creatine group. The corresponding decline was 5.82 (SD=6.77) in the historical controls. The difference between the two sample means exceeded the stopping criterion. The null hypothesis of superiority was not rejected in the futility analysis. Skin rash occurred more frequently in the celecoxib-creatine group. In conclusion, the celecoxib-creatine combination was selected as preferable to the minocycline-creatine combination for further evaluation. This phase II design was efficient, leading to treatment selection after just 60 patients, and can be used in other phase II trials to assess different agents."

The excellent results of this pilot study engendered considerable optimism among patients, their families, patients' associations, and the scientific community. This report sparked numerous phase ii clinical trials. Many patients who were not included in these studies used all resources at their disposal to access the drug as treatment under a compassionate use programme.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of lithium in ALS using a meta-analysis of the information reported in 12 studies which were examined for methodological quality.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: . Searches were performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and EudraCT (January 1996-August 2012).\nRESULTS: To date, we have information on more 1100 patients treated with lithium. Unfortunately, the results do not confirm the positive effect described in the pilot study, which suggests that this drug is not effective at slowing disease progression. Two trials had to be suspended before the scheduled completion date due to the ineffectiveness of the drug as well as numerous adverse effects. A recently published study also ruled out any possible modest effect.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to suggest that lithium has no short-term benefits in ALS. A comparison of the group of patients treated with lithium+riluzole and the control group treated with riluzole alone showed no statistically significant differences in rates of functional decline, deterioration of respiratory function, or survival time. Furthermore, there was no evidence that it was more effective than the placebo."

In the present study, we found that daily doses of lithium, leading to plasma levels ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 mEq/liter, delay disease progression in human patients affected by ALS. None of the patients treated with lithium died during the 15 months of the follow-up, and disease progression was markedly attenuated when compared with age-, disease duration-, and sex-matched control patients treated with riluzole for the same amount of time. In a parallel study on a genetic ALS animal model, the G93A mouse, we found a marked neuroprotection by lithium, which delayed disease onset and duration and augmented the life span. These effects were concomitant with activation of autophagy and an increase in the number of the mitochondria in motor neurons and suppressed reactive astrogliosis. Again, lithium reduced the slow necrosis characterized by mitochondrial vacuolization and increased the number of neurons counted in lamina VII that were severely affected in saline-treated G93A mice. After lithium administration in G93A mice, the number of these neurons was higher even when compared with saline-treated WT. All these mechanisms may contribute to the effects of lithium, and these results offer a promising perspective for the treatment of human patients affected by ALS."

She was found to be homozygous for a previously unreported missense mutation (T1886G), which leads to low, but not totally deficient, GALC activity.\nCONCLUSIONS: Expression of this mutation in COS-1 cells using the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) resulted in low, although not null, GALC activity, which can explain the protracted clinical course in this patient. Patients carrying the mutation described herein might be potential candidates for therapeutic trials, such as bone marrow transplantation or gene therapy."

This study underscores the mechanism of action of psychosine in the regulation of oligodendrocyte cell death via the generation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and arachidonic acid (AA) by the activation of secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2). There was a significant increase in the level of LPC, indicating a phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-dependent pathobiology, in the brains of Krabbe disease patients and those of twitcher mice, an animal model of Krabbe disease. In vitro studies of the treatment of primary oligodendrocytes and the oligodendrocyte MO3.13 cell line with psychosine also showed the generation of LPC and the release of AA in a dose- and time-dependent manner, indicating psychosine-induced activation of PLA2. Studies with various pharmacological inhibitors of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and sPLA2 and psychosine-mediated induction of sPLA2 enzymatic activity in media supernatant suggest that psychosine-induced release of AA and generation of LPC is mainly contributed by sPLA2. An inhibitor of sPLA2, 7,7-dimethyl eicosadienoic acid, completely attenuated the psychosine-mediated accumulation of LPC levels, release of AA, and generation of reactive oxygen species, and blocked oligodendroyte cell death, as evident from cell survival, DNA fragmentation, and caspase 3 activity assays. This study documents for the first time that psychosine-induced cell death is mediated via the sPLA2 signaling pathway and that inhibitors of sPLA2 may hold a therapeutic potential for protection against oligodendrocyte cell death and resulting demyelination in Krabbe disease."

Present knowledge on molecular genetics and the characterization of the different mutations that affect the Alport's gene will lead to classification of this syndrome in subtypes, according to those mutations, and to its phenotypic expressions; in addition, some syndromes, phenotypically similar, will probably have to be distinguished from Alport's disease, in a future, if a genetic alteration is found in genes other than COL4A5."

Alport first published his description of a triad of symptoms in a family with hereditary congenital haemorrhagic nephritis, deafness and ocular changes. A few years after his death, this group of symptoms was renamed Alport syndrome. To this day, Alport syndrome still inevitably leads to end-stage renal disease and the need for renal replacement therapy, starting in young adulthood. During the past two decades, research into this rare disease has focused on the effects of mutations in collagen type IV and the role of changes in podocytes and the glomerular basement membrane that lead to early kidney fibrosis. Animal models of Alport syndrome also demonstrate the pathogenetic importance of interactions between podocytes and the extracellular matrix. Such models might also help researchers to answer basic questions about podocyte function and the development of fibrosis, and to develop new therapeutic approaches that might be of use in other kidney diseases. In this Review, we discuss the latest basic and clinical research on Alport syndrome, focusing on the roles of podocyte pathology and the extracellular matrix. We also highlight early diagnosis and treatment options for young patients with this disorder."

New signs have been described which can be useful both for diagnosis and for prognosticating the risk of complications. This study examines and describes a triad comprising the unusual 'stair-case' foveal sign, together with choroidal thinning and late-stage peripheral schisis in a patient with Alport syndrome.\nCASE PRESENTATION: This is a case report of a 49-year-old Caucasian male with a background of X-linked Alport syndrome presenting with gradual and progressive diminution of vision in the left eye with a central blur. He had already undergone three renal allografts, was deaf and suffered from hypertension by the time of his first presentation to ophthalmology. On examination, corrected visual acuity was 6/9.5 in the right eye and 6/30 in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography imaging showed an unusual 'stair-case' sign of the fovea in both eyes, together with choroidal thinning. We postulate that an abnormal vitreomacular interface followed by vitreomacular traction and eventually separation, removing layers of the inner retina with the vitreous, led to this unusual appearance. Subsequently, this patient also developed schitic changes more peripherally in the retina which progressed over the following 5\u2009years.\nCONCLUSION: The stair-case foveal sign, choroidal thinning and mid-peripheral schisis are three signs that clinicians might expect to encounter on optical coherence tomography imaging of patients with Alport syndrome. These findings can be attributed to unique mutations of collagen IV which lead to a variety of clinical phenotypes affecting basement membrane structures. Identification of these features may not only be useful diagnostically and in forecasting complications such as macular holes, but also predict mode of inheritance and likelihood of early-onset renal failure."

She was referred to Daisan Hospital of the Jikei University School of Medicine on April 1, 1991 for refractory thrombocytopenia. She had shown sensorineural hearing loss since the age of 6 years and her peripheral blood smear revealed giant platelets on admission. She was treated with interferon, prednisolone, and high-dose gamma-globulin (400 mg/day x 5 days). However, the platelet count did not increase, but hypermenorrhea continued. She subsequently showed proteinuria and hematuria. She underwent splenectomy and renal biopsy on August 12, 1992. The glomeruli appeared to be almost normal under light microscopy. The interstitium showed regional fibrosis containing foam cells and the renal tubuli showed mild atrophy. Under electronmicroscopy, the basement membrane of the glomeruli was associated with mesangial interposition and the lamina densa was split into several layers. These ultrastructural findings were compatible with those of Alport's syndrome."

Secondary outcomes were rates of deterioration of ALS Functional Rating Scale-Respiratory and muscle strength. The primary intention-to-treat analysis was the survival comparison of drug vs placebo, assessed before (log-rank test) and after adjustment (Cox model) for predefined prognostic factors.\nRESULTS: At the end of the study, after 547 days of follow-up, 103 patients (51.7%) in the pentoxifylline group and 120 (59.7%) in the placebo group were alive (unadjusted risk 1.28, p = 0.107; adjusted risk 1.43, p = 0.02).

Progress in symptomatic treatments has been more important. Nutrition and ventilation are now an important focus of ALS therapy. Several studies have firmly established that noninvasive ventilation improves patients' quality of life and prolongs survival.

As on previous occasions, the results obtained in the laboratory are not reproduced in clinical practice. The reasons for this new disappointment in translational medicine are analysed by applying the successes obtained in the experimental animal model for ALS to humans. The most frequently suggested causes for explaining these continuous failures are unawareness of the correct dosage to be used, the ideal duration of the clinical trial in phase III, sample size, the search for a primary outcome for measurement other than survival, the need for biomarkers giving information on the progression of the disease and whether this is modified by the introduction of the drug for study. Debate focuses on whether the transgenic mouse model of ALS which expresses SOD1 mutations which we have been using for more than a decade is an exact reflection of the clinical profile and the physiopathogenic mechanisms present in patients with spo- radic ALS. There is the possibility that depending on the dose administered, minocycline can be a neuroprotector or a neurotoxin. In other words, at a dose of 200 mg/day, this drug behaves like <<Dr. Jekyll>> and like <<Mr. Hyde>> at doses of 400 mg. For the authors of the trial, this possibility does not seem to be the cause of the disappointing results obtained. However, they acknowledge that one of the limitations of their study was that it was impossible to compare the effects of minocycline in the patient after receiving 200 or 400 mg. For many other researchers running ongoing clinical trials in both ALS and other neurological diseases, the dose of 200 mg/day is chosen as ideal for testing the effectiveness of minocycline in patients. The strategy of administering the maximum dose of a drug to be tested may give rise to misleading results. We agree with the opinion of other authors, who say that minocycline should be given a"

It reduces apoptosis in mouse models of Huntington's disease and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and is in clinical trial for sporadic ALS. Because apoptosis also occurs after brain and spinal cord (SCI) injury, its prevention may be useful in improving recovery. We analyzed minocycline's neuroprotective effects over 28 days following contusion SCI and found significant functional recovery compared to tetracycline. Histology, immunocytochemistry, and image analysis indicated statistically significant tissue sparing, reduced apoptosis and microgliosis, and less activated caspase-3 and substrate cleavage. Since our original report in abstract form, others have published both positive and negative effects of minocycline in various rodent models of SCI and with various routes of administration. We have since found decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha, as well as caspase-3 mRNA expression, as possible mechanisms of action for minocycline's ameliorative action. These results support reports that modulating apoptosis, caspases, and microglia provide promising therapeutic targets for prevention and/or limiting the degree of functional loss after CNS trauma. Minocycline, and more potent chemically synthesized tetracyclines, may find a place in the therapeutic arsenal to promote recovery early after SCI in humans."

Secondary endpoints were rates of change of various functional measures. In Study 1, primary outcome measures did not reach statistical significance. For the 2 mg group, for time to VC<50% analysis (without DTP) a significant 30% RRR was obtained (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.46, P=0.009). In Study 2, no significant results were obtained. However, there was a trend in favour of add-on 1 mg dose xaliproden vs. placebo (RRR 15% [-6.31, ns] for time to VC<50%; RRR 12% [CI: -6.27, ns] for time to VC<50% or DTP). Adjusted RR ratios were consistently more favourable for the xaliproden groups. Tolerability was good, and dose-dependent side effects were largely associated with the serotonergic properties of xaliproden. An effect of xaliproden on functional parameters, especially VC, was noted. Although this effect did not reach statistical significance, xaliproden had a small effect on clinically noteworthy aspects of disease progression in ALS."

Sitting SVC was not significantly different between the treatments. In post hoc analysis using period-wise baselines, supine SVC favoured levosimendan over placebo, estimated mean differences from baseline being -3.62% on placebo, +0.77% on levosimendan 1\u2009mg daily (p=0.018) and +2.38% on 1\u2009mg two times a day (p=0.001).

Riluzole prolongs survival in ALS. A published report has suggested a dramatic effect of lithium carbonate on survival. 44 patients were studied, with 16 randomly selected to take LiCO3 and riluzole and 28 allocated to take riluzole alone. In the group treated with lithium, no patients had died (i.e., 100% survival) at the end of the study (15 months from entry), compared to 71% surviving in the riluzole-only group. Although the trial can be criticised on several grounds, there is a substantial rationale from other laboratory studies that lithium is worth investigating therapeutically in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."

The combinations of minocycline-creatine and celecoxib-creatine have additive effects in the murine model. New trial designs are needed to efficiently screen the growing number of potential neuroprotective agents. Our objective was to assess two drug combinations in ALS using a novel phase II trial design. We conducted a randomized, double-blind selection trial in sequential pools of 60 patients. Participants received minocycline (100 mg)-creatine (10 g) twice daily or celecoxib (400 mg)-creatine (10 g) twice daily for six months. The primary objective was treatment selection based on which combination best slowed deterioration in the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R); the trial could be stopped after one pool if the difference between the two arms was adequately large. At trial conclusion, each arm was compared to a historical control group in a futility analysis. Safety measures were also examined. After the first patient pool, the mean six-month decline in ALSFRS-R was 5.27 (SD=5.54) in the celecoxib-creatine group and 6.47 (SD=9.14) in the minocycline-creatine group. The corresponding decline was 5.82 (SD=6.77) in the historical controls. The difference between the two sample means exceeded the stopping criterion. The null hypothesis of superiority was not rejected in the futility analysis. Skin rash occurred more frequently in the celecoxib-creatine group. In conclusion, the celecoxib-creatine combination was selected as preferable to the minocycline-creatine combination for further evaluation. This phase II design was efficient, leading to treatment selection after just 60 patients, and can be used in other phase II trials to assess different agents."

Group differences in the rate of decline were not significant between the groups for the ALS Functional Rating Scale (p = 0.36) or for the secondary variables. The toxicity and negative efficacy trends discourage further indinavir trials in ALS."

Patients with clinically probable or definite ALS of more than 6 months and less than 5 years duration were randomly assigned to placebo, 1 mg or 2 mg xaliproden orally once daily as monotherapy in Study 1 (n=867); or to the same regimen with addition of riluzole 50 mg bid background therapy in Study 2 (n=1210 patients). The two primary endpoints were defined as: 1. Time to death, tracheostomy, or permanent assisted ventilation (DTP), and 2. Time to vital capacity (VC)<50% or DTP before (log-rank test) and after adjustment using a Cox proportional hazard model for prespecified prognostic factors. Secondary endpoints were rates of change of various functional measures. In Study 1, primary outcome measures did not reach statistical significance. For the 2 mg group, for time to VC<50% analysis (without DTP) a significant 30% RRR was obtained (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.46, P=0.009). In Study 2, no significant results were obtained. However, there was a trend in favour of add-on 1 mg dose xaliproden vs. placebo (RRR 15% [-6.31, ns] for time to VC<50%; RRR 12% [CI: -6.27, ns] for time to VC<50% or DTP). Adjusted RR ratios were consistently more favourable for the xaliproden groups. Tolerability was good, and dose-dependent side effects were largely associated with the serotonergic properties of xaliproden. An effect of xaliproden on functional parameters, especially VC, was noted. Although this effect did not reach statistical significance, xaliproden had a small effect on clinically noteworthy aspects of disease progression in ALS."

Although mutant SOD1 is known to induce motor neuron death via multiple adverse acquired functions, its exact pathogenic mechanism is not well defined. SOD1 toxicity is dose dependent; levels of mutant SOD1 protein in transgenic mice determine disease susceptibility, onset and rate of progression. We therefore sought to identify small molecules that reduce SOD1 levels by inhibiting the SOD1 promoter. We tested pyrimethamine (previously reported to suppress SOD1 expression), several compounds currently in trials in human and murine ALS, and a set of 1040 FDA-approved compounds. In a PC12 cell-based assay, no compounds reduced SOD1 promoter activity without concomitant cytotoxicity. Additionally, pyrimethamine failed to repress levels of SOD1 protein in HeLa cells or homogenates of liver, spinal cord and brain of wild-type mice. Thirty-four compounds (including riluzole, ceftriaxone, minocyclin, PBA, lithium, acetylcysteine) in human and mouse ALS trials and an additional set of 1040 FDA-approved compounds also showed no effect on SOD1 promoter activity. This present study thus failed to identify small molecule inhibitors of SOD1 gene expression."

Recently, TDP-43 has been identified as a key protein in the pathogenesis of some cases of ALS. Although the role of TDP-43 in motor neuron degeneration is not yet known, TDP-43 has been shown to accumulate in RNA stress granules (SGs) in cell models and in spinal cord tissue from ALS patients. The SG association may be an early pathological change to TDP-43 metabolism and as such a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Accumulation of TDP-43 in SGs induced by inhibition of mitochondrial activity can be inhibited by modulation of cellular kinase activity. We have also found that treatment of cells and animal models of neurodegeneration, including an ALS model, with bioavailable bis(thiosemicarbazonato)copper(II) complexes (Cu(II)(btsc)s) can modulate kinase activity and induce neuroprotective effects. In this study we examined the effect of diacetylbis(-methylthiosemicarbazonato)copper(II) (Cu(II)(atsm)) and glyoxalbis(-methylthiosemicarbazonato)copper(II) (Cu(II)(gtsm)) on TDP-43-positive SGs induced in SH-SY5Y cells in culture. We found that the Cu(II)(btsc)s blocked formation of TDP-43-and human antigen R (HuR)-positive SGs induced by paraquat. The Cu(II)(btsc)s protected neurons from paraquat-mediated cell death. These effects were associated with inhibition of ERK phosphorylation. Co-treatment of cultures with either Cu(II)(atsm) or an ERK inhibitor, PD98059 both prevented ERK activation and blocked formation of TDP-43-and HuR-positive SGs. Cu(II)(atsm) treatment or ERK inhibition also prevented abnormal ubiquitin accumulation in paraquat-treated cells suggesting a link between prolonged ERK activation and abnormal ubiquitin metabolism in paraquat stress and inhibition by Cu. Moreover, Cu(II)(atsm) reduced accumulation of C-terminal (219-414) TDP-43 in transfected SH-SY5Y cells. These results demonstrate that Cu(II)(btsc) complexes could potentially be developed as a"

Assessment of health-related function used the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection tool (PODCI).\nRESULTS: One hundred thirty one patients received edasalonexent (n\u200a=\u200a88) and placebo (n\u200a=\u200a43). At week 52, differences between edasalonexent and placebo for NSAA total score and TFTs were not statistically significant, although there were consistently less functional declines in the edasalonexent group. A pre-specified analysis by age demonstrated that younger patients (\u22646.0 years) showed more robust and statistically significant differences between edasalonexent and placebo for some assessments. Treatment was well-tolerated and the majority of adverse events were mild, and most commonly involved the gastrointestinal system (primarily diarrhea).\nCONCLUSIONS: Edasalonexent was generally well-tolerated with a manageable safety profile at the dose of 100\u200amg/kg/day. Although edasalonexent did not achieve statistical significance for improvement in primary and secondary functional endpoints for assessment of DMD, subgroup analysis suggested that edasalonexent may slow disease progression if initiated before 6 years of age.

Typically, DMD patients pass away from heart failure or respiratory failure. Currently, there is no cure, though exon-skipping therapy including eteplirsen (brand name Exondys 51), a synthetic antisense oligonucleotide designed to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene, is considered especially promising. Applicable to approximately 14% of DMD patients, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) antisense oligonucleotide eteplirsen received accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016. Throughout clinical trials, eteplirsen has been well tolerated by patients with no serious drug-related adverse events. The most common events observed are balance disorder, vomiting, and skin rash. Despite its safety and promise of functional benefits, eteplirsen remains controversial due to its low production of dystrophin. In addition, unmodified PMOs have limited efficacy in the heart. To address these concerns of efficacy, eteplirsen has been conjugated to a proprietary cell-penetrating peptide; the conjugate is called SRP-5051. Compared to eteplirsen, SRP-5051 aims to better prompt exon-skipping and dystrophin production but may have greater toxicity concerns. This paper reviews and discusses the available information on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability data of eteplirsen and SRP-5051 from preclinical and clinical trials. Issues faced by eteplirsen and SRP-5051, including efficacy and safety, are identified. Lastly, the current state of eteplirsen and exon-skipping therapy in general as a strategy for the treatment of DMD are discussed."

Loss-of-function mutations in the DMD gene, which codes for dystrophin, lead to this disease. The majority of mutations in this gene result in the exclusion of one or more exons from the transcript, eventually causing the remaining exons not to fit together correctly (i.e., out-of-frame mutations). Antisense oligonucleotides, e.g., phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), can induce therapeutic exon skipping during pre-mRNA processing to restore the reading frame of the primary transcript of DMD. As a result, truncated but partially functional dystrophin is produced, potentially slowing down the disease progression. Golodirsen is a provisionally approved PMO-based drug for approx. 8% of all DMD patients amenable to exon 53 skipping. This article summarizes golodirsen's pharmacology, efficacy and safety information. It also discusses some controversies that golodirsen met after the approval."

Genetic confirmation has become standard in recent years. Improvements in the standard of care for DMD have led to improved survival. Novel treatments for DMD have focused on reducing the dystrophic mechanism of the muscle disease, modulating utrophin protein expression, and restoring dystrophin protein expression. Among the strategies to reduce the dystrophic mechanisms are 1) inhibiting inflammation, 2) promoting muscle growth and regeneration, 3) reducing fibrosis, and 4) facilitating mitochondrial function. The agents under investigation include a novel steroid, myostatin inhibitors, idebenone, an anti-CTGF antibody, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, and cardiosphere-derived cells. For utrophin modulation, AAV-mediated gene therapy with GALGT2 is currently being investigated to upregulate utrophin expression. Finally, the strategies for dystrophin protein restoration include 1) nonsense readthrough, 2) synthetic antisense oligonucleotides for exon skipping, and 3) AAV-mediated micro/minidystrophin gene delivery. With newer agents, we are witnessing the use of more advanced biotechnological methods. Although these potential breakthroughs provide significant promise, they may also raise new questions regarding treatment effect and safety."

Fat fractions (FFs) in vastus lateralis and soleus muscles were determined with 1H MRS. MRI quantitative T<sub>2</sub> (qT<sub>2</sub>) values were measured for 3 muscles of the upper leg and 5 muscles of the lower leg. Longitudinal changes in biomarkers were modeled with a cumulative distribution function using a nonlinear mixed-effects approach.\nRESULTS: MRS FF and MRI qT<sub>2</sub> increased with DMD disease duration, with the progression time constants differing markedly between individuals and across muscles. The average age at half-maximal muscle involvement (\u03bc) occurred 4.8 years earlier in vastus lateralis than soleus, and these measures were strongly associated with loss-of-ambulation age. Corticosteroid treatment was found to delay \u03bc by 2.5 years on average across muscles, although there were marked differences between muscles with more slowly progressing muscles showing larger delay.\nCONCLUSIONS: MRS FF and MRI qT<sub>2</sub> provide sensitive noninvasive measures of DMD progression. Modeling changes in these biomarkers across multiple muscles can be used to detect and monitor the therapeutic effects of corticosteroids on disease progression and to provide prognostic information on functional outcomes.

In this study, we hypothesized that the expression levels of specific serum circulating miRNAs may be useful to monitor the pathological progression of muscular diseases, and therefore explored the possibility of these miRNAs as new biomarkers for muscular diseases. To confirm this hypothesis, we quantified the expression levels of miRNAs in serum of the dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy mouse model, mdx, and the canine X-linked muscular dystrophy in Japan dog model (CXMD(J)), by real-time PCR. We found that the serum levels of several muscle-specific miRNAs (miR-1, miR-133a and miR-206) are increased in both mdx and CXMD(J). Interestingly, unlike CK levels, expression levels of these miRNAs in mdx serum are little influenced by exercise using treadmill. These results suggest that serum miRNAs are useful and reliable biomarkers for muscular dystrophy."

Family history, clinical signs, and treatment data were reported for patients with DMD and BMD at different rates. All six serum biochemical indexes could accurately distinguish between DMD and BMD patients. Copy number variations were the most frequent mutation type (79.2% in DMD and 84.3% in BMD), of which large deletions accounted for 88.4 and 88.6%, large duplications accounted for 11.6 and 11.4% in DMD and BMD, respectively. An exon deletion hotspot, located in exons 45-54, was observed in DMD, and intron 44 was the most frequent deletion starting point (26.5%). Duplication and single nucleotide variations appeared to be uniformly distributed among all exons. Eleven patients were identified to have ultrarare mutation types. Eleven other patients suffered from two separate mutations simultaneously, some of which may have taken place via dependent mechanisms.

A total of 85 individuals (including ambulatory and nonambulatory subjects) underwent ultrasound examinations of the gastrocnemius for deep learning of image data using LeNet, AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-16<sub>TL</sub>, VGG-19, and VGG-19<sub>TL</sub> models (the notation TL indicates fine-tuning pretrained models).

The objective of this study was to enhance the quantitative understanding of DMD disease progression through nonlinear mixed effects modeling of the population mean and variability of the 6-min walk test (6MWT) clinical endpoint. An indirect response model with a latent process was fit to digitized literature data using full Bayesian estimation. The modeling data set consisted of 22 healthy controls and 218 DMD patients from one interventional and four observational trials. The model reasonably described the central tendency and population variability of the 6MWT in healthy subjects and DMD patients. An exploratory categorical covariate analysis indicated that there was no apparent effect of corticosteroid administration on DMD disease progression. The population predicted 6MWT began to rise at 1.32 years of age, plateauing at 654 meters (m) at 17.2 years of age for the healthy population. The DMD trajectory reached a maximum of 411 m at 8.90 years before declining and falling below 1 m at age 18.0.

The models were validated on external data sets and captured longitudinal changes in the five measures well, including both early disease when function improves as a result of growth and development and the decline in function in later stages. The models can be used in the CTS platform to perform trial simulations to optimize the selection of inclusion/exclusion criteria, selection of measures, and other trial parameters. The data sets and models have been reviewed by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency; have been accepted into the Fit-for-Purpose and Qualification for Novel Methodologies pathways, respectively; and will be submitted for potential endorsement by both agencies."

These normal values were compared with values obtained in 16 ambulant patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) aged 5-8 years to study the extent of functional impairment. In ambulant patients with DMD, we found that muscle function assessed by timed functional tests (running 9 m and rising up from the floor) and muscle force assessed by hand-held dynamometry were severely impaired. However, a small reduction of muscle force was accompanied by a large reduction in functional ability. Therefore, in our group of ambulant patients with DMD, timed functional testing was the most sensitive parameter to determine the extent of disease progression. Timed functional testing may therefore be considered as an additional outcome measure in drug trials to evaluate the effects of therapy in ambulant patients with DMD and possibly in other neuromuscular disorders."

            "response": "The most commonly used diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) include multiplex PCR of the most commonly deleted exons, quantitative analysis of all exons of the gene, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), Southern Blot, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), use of the Short Tandem Repeat (STR), polymorphic length restriction fragments (RFLP), Western Blot for the study of the protein, array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), PCR-based Sanger sequencing, and next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based targeted gene analysis.\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of these diagnostic tests?\n\nAnswer: The purpose of these diagnostic tests is to identify the genetic mutations causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), to confirm the diagnosis, and to determine the genetic status of family members, which is essential for genetic counseling and prenatal testing.\n\nQuestion: What are the advantages of using these diagnostic tests?\n\nAnswer: The advantages of using these diagnostic tests include improved mutation detection rate, accurate diagnosis, and the ability to identify the genetic mutations causing DMD, which is essential for genetic counseling and prenatal testing. Additionally, these tests have permitted improved study of the various families affected and thus improved the quality of life of the families at risk.\n\nQuestion: Are there any non-invasive diagnostic tests for DMD?\n\nAnswer: Yes, a recent study has identified titin fragments in the urine of DMD patients as a potential non-invasive biomarker for the disease. This could potentially lead to the development of a simple, non-invasive, and easy-to-use test for pre-screening of muscular dystrophies.\n\nQuestion: How have advances in genetic testing impacted the diagnosis of DMD?\n\nAnswer: Advances in genetic testing have significantly improved the diagnosis of DMD, allowing for earlier and more accurate diagnosis. According to a study, the mean age at genetic diagnosis of nm-DMD has decreased from 10 years to 5 years 9 months over a 10-year period, reflecting the change in the age at genetic diagnosis and diagnostic approach to nm-DMD depending on the advances and availability of genetic testing.",

It is characterized by the slow degeneration of muscle fibres, so that the patient has become an invalid by the age of 10 years, followed by death from respiratory or cardiac failure. It has a sex linked recessive mode of inheritance.\nDEVELOPMENT: The gene causing this disorder is the DMD gene and is found on the short arm of the X chromosome. The commonest mutations of this gene are deletions. Many molecular techniques for study of the disorder have been developed over the years. These include the Southern Blot, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), use of the Short Tandem Repeat (STR), polymorphic length restriction fragments (RFLP), Western Blot for the study of the protein and others.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this paper we review the diagnostic tests most widely used in this disease. These have permitted improved study of the various families affected and thus improved the quality of life of the families at risk."

The DMD gene (DMD) is the biggest human gene and the most common molecular defect in the DMD gene, accounting for approximately 65 % of cases of DMD, is the deletion of one or more exons. The most basic method still in regular use involves multiplex PCR of the exons, known to be most commonly deleted. The multiplex is relatively simple. Quantitative analysis of all exons of the gene and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification have brought about an improvement in mutation detection rate, as they will detect all exon scale deletions as well as duplications, widely used to detect exonic and intronic mutations. As a sensitive and discriminative tool, MLPA can be used for prenatal testing. A more recent development in quantitative analysis is the use of oligonucleotide-based array comparative genomic hybridization."

The mutation spectrum of DMD is unique in that 65% of causative mutations are intragenic deletions, with intragenic duplications and point mutations (along with other sequence variants) accounting for 6% to 10% and 30% to 35%, respectively. The strategy for molecular diagnostic testing for DMD involves initial screening for deletions/duplications using microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) followed by full-sequence analysis of DMD for sequence variants. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based targeted gene analysis has become clinically available for detection of point mutations and other sequence variants (small insertions, deletions, and indels). This unit initially discusses the strategic algorithm for establishing a molecular diagnosis of DMD and later provides detailed protocols of current molecular diagnostic methods for DMD, including array-CGH, PCR-based Sanger sequencing, and NGS-based sequencing assay."

The aim of the present study was to identify urinary biomarkers as a diagnostic tool for muscular dystrophies. Here, the urinary proteomes of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients and healthy donors were compared with a bottom-up proteomic approach. Label-free analysis of more than 1100 identified proteins revealed that 32 of them were differentially expressed between healthy controls and DMD patients. Among these 32 proteins, titin showed the highest fold change between healthy subjects and DMD patients. Interestingly, most of the sequenced peptides belong to the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of titin, and the presence of the corresponding fragments in the urine of DMD patients was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Analysis of a large cohort of DMD patients and age-matched controls (a total of 104 individuals aged from 3 to 20 years) confirmed presence of the N-ter fragment in all but two patients. In two DMD patients aged 16 and 20 years this fragment was undetectable and two healthy controls of 16 and 19 years with serum CK >800 IU/L demonstrated a low level of the fragment. N- and C-terminal titin fragments were also detected in urine from patients with other muscular dystrophies such as Becker muscular dystrophy and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (type 1D, 2D and 2J) but not in neurogenic spinal muscular atrophy. They were also present in urine of dystrophin-deficient animal models (GRMD dogs and mdx mice). Titin is the first urinary biomarker that offers the possibility to develop a simple, non-invasive and easy-to-use test for pre-screening of muscular dystrophies, and may also prove to be useful for the non-invasive follow up of DMD patients under treatment."

In the family the clinical presentation was characterized by relatively early age of onset, spinal onset with proximal distribution weakness, bulbar involvement and a rapid disease course. Molecular analysis showed a heterozygous mutation at codon 106 resulting in a substitution of phenylalanine for leucine in the SOD1 protein (L106F).

Several studies have pointed to a variety of functions of mutant SOD1, which has enhanced catalytic activity of the peroxynitrite-mediated tyrosine nitration, readily releases the reactive Cu ions, induces apoptotic cell death, has enhanced peroxidase activity, damages the mitochondria to release Ca2+, and forms SOD1-containing aggregates in the cytoplasm. Many of these studies have obtained evidence for increased oxidative damage in ALS. On the other hand, some reports disagree with oxidative damage involvement in SOD1 mutant ALS. In considering the findings of increased oxidative damage in mutant SOD1-expressing transgenic mice, it should be remembered that overexpression of mutant SOD1 may enhance oxidative stress generation from this enzyme. In this review, we present the clinicopathological features of SOD1 mutant familial ALS and its transgenic mouse model, and also discuss SOD1 mutation-related neurotoxicity, including SOD1 protein aggregation and post-translational protein modification."

This method is time consuming compared to the newly introduced multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification method. Multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification is a method suitable for relative quantification of several DNA sequences in one reaction. The authors report results on 93 cases where the carrier status was analysed simultaneously by cDNA hybridisation and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification technique. In 42 cases the carrier state was confirmed and in this carrier population the authors additionally detected two cases with duplication, two cases with one copy of the whole dystrophin gene and three manifest carrier females. On the basis of these results the MLPA technique, which has been newly introduced in Hungary, proved to be a sensitive and quick method for the detection of carrier state in the DMD/BMD disease. Moreover, the exact deletion or duplication border can be detected and as a result, prediction on the phenotype can be given.

To investigate mutation types and distribution characteristics of dystrophin gene in Chinese DMD patients, we used Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to analyze the dystrophin gene in 720 DMD patients, their mothers, and 20 normal adult males. Results showed that detection rate was 64.9% (467/720) in all the patients, gene deletion rate was 54.3% (391/720), and gene duplication rate was 10.6% (76/720). The rate of deletion mutant occurred in Exon 45-54 was 71.9% (281/391) in all gene deletion patients; meanwhile, the rate of gene duplication occurred in Exon 1-40 was 82.9% (63/76) in all gene duplication ones. In all the patients with gene deletion and duplication, the rate of DMD and IMD was 90.6% (423/467), and BMD, 9.4% (44/467). This indicates that the main reason of duchenne muscular dystrophy is dystrophin gene deletion mutation, which would occur in any gene unevenly with hot spots of mutation. The location and fragment length of gene deletion and duplication cannot decide the severity of clinical symptoms directly."

The most basic method still in regular use involves multiplex PCR of the exons, known to be most commonly deleted. The multiplex is relatively simple. Quantitative analysis of all exons of the gene and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification have brought about an improvement in mutation detection rate, as they will detect all exon scale deletions as well as duplications, widely used to detect exonic and intronic mutations. As a sensitive and discriminative tool, MLPA can be used for prenatal testing. A more recent development in quantitative analysis is the use of oligonucleotide-based array comparative genomic hybridization."

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is not just a muscle disorder, but also a disease that affects the brain. The aim of the present study was to describe a case series of children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy that have also the presence of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). They have been assessed by means of standardized autism scales and the most appropriate psycho-educational treatment is herein discussed.\nMETHODS: In order to evaluate and identify the presence and intensity of autistic symptoms have been used the Childhood Autism Rating Scale and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule tools. Moreover, in order to assess the intelligence of subjects and their lower limb function, Wisch-R intelligence scale and Vignos function scale were used, respectively.\nRESULTS: Atypical behaviors included a preference for being alone, and selective interest in privileged objects used in a stereotyped manner, motor fretting, and attention instability were present in all children.

We included observational studies in the population with Becker or Duchenne muscular dystrophies (BMD, DMD) that estimated the prevalence of these disorders according to Dp140 and/or Dp71 genotype. Meta-analysis of the prevalence ratio (PR) of genotype comparisons was conducted for each disorder.\nRESULTS: Ten studies were included in the systematic review. In BMD, Dp140+ vs. Dp140- and Dp71+ vs. Dp71- were associated with developmental disorders with a PR of 0.11 (0.04, 0.34) and 0.22 (0.07, 0.67), respectively.

The cumulative incidence of disease was 19.7 per 100,000 male live births and 1 in 5076 live born males were diagnosed with DMD. Differences in disease incidence were not statistically different when compared between 2002-2007 and 2008-2012 (incidence rate ratio\u2009=\u20091.13, 95% CI 0.76-1.69, p\u2009=\u20090.52).

The cost of these new treatments is beyond the reach of most developing countries. At this time, there is no cure for the disorder. In spite of mutations of the SERPING1 gene, autoimmunity and infections are not prominent features of the condition.

We suggest several novel potential treatment options for HAE from the perspectives of clinical immunology, molecular biology, and liver transplantation. Many of these offer the prospect of curing the disorder. The effectiveness of these options is rapidly improving in many cases, and their risks are decreasing.

Almost all cases of HAE are caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene resulting in a deficiency in functional plasma C1 esterase inhibitor (C1EI), a serine protease inhibitor that normally inhibits proteases in the contact, complement, and fibrinolytic systems. Current treatment of HAE includes long-term prophylaxis with attenuated androgens or human plasma-derived C1EI and management of acute attacks with human plasma-derived or recombinant C1EI, bradykinin, and kallikrein inhibitors, each of which requires repeated administration. As an approach to effectively treat HAE with a single treatment, we hypothesized that a one-time intravenous administration of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene transfer vector expressing the genetic sequence of the normal human C1 esterase inhibitor (AAVrh.10hC1EI) would provide sustained circulating C1EI levels sufficient to prevent angioedema episodes.\nMETHODS: To study the efficacy of AAVrh.10hC1EI, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to create a heterozygote C1EI-deficient mouse model (S63\u00b1) that shares characteristics associated with HAE in humans including decreased plasma C1EI and C4 levels. Phenotypically, these mice have increased vascular permeability of skin and internal organs.\nRESULTS: Systemic administration of AAVrh.10hC1EI to the S63\u00b1 mice resulted in sustained human C1EI activity levels above the predicted therapeutic levels and correction of the vascular leak in skin and internal organs.\nCONCLUSION: A single treatment with AAVrh.10hC1EI has the potential to provide long-term protection from angioedema attacks in affected individuals."

These attacks are mediated by excessive bradykinin production, as a result of uncontrolled activation of the plasma kallikrein/kinin system, which is caused by a C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency or dysfunction in HAE types 1 and 2, respectively. For many years, treatment options were limited to therapies with substantial adverse effects, insufficient efficacy, or difficult routes of administration. Increased insights in the pathophysiology of HAE have paved the way for the development of new therapies with fewer side effects. In the last two decades, several targeted novel therapeutic strategies for HAE have been developed, for both long-term prophylaxis and on demand treatment of acute attacks. This article reviews the advances in the development of more effective and convenient treatment options for HAE and their anticipated effects on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. The emergence of these improved treatment options will presumably change current HAE guidelines, but adherence to these recommendations may become restricted by high treatment costs. It will therefore be essential to determine the indications and identify the patients that will benefit most from these newest treatment generations. Ultimately, current preclinical research into gene therapies may eventually lead the way towards curative treatment options for HAE. In conclusion, an increasing shift towards the use of highly effective long-term prophylaxis is anticipated, which should drastically abate the burden on patients with hereditary angioedema."

In 1989, the CF gene was isolated and characterized and the major mutation (delta F508), a 3-bp deletion that results in the loss of a phenylalanine residue at position 508, was detected. To determine the frequency of the delta F508 mutation and the predicted number of additional mutations in our population, we have undertaken a collaborative study of 215 CF patients and 175 CF parents in Switzerland. The delta F508 mutation in exon 10 has been found in 70% of the CF chromosomes, and the exon-11 mutation R553X seems to be the second most common CF mutation in our population, with a frequency of 5.3%, whereas the G551D mutation (also in exon 11) has not been detected at all. Haplotype determination of 430 CF and 175 normal chromosomes using XV-2c, KM19, MP6d-9, and J3.11 has been proven to be very helpful in providing additional carrier risk calculations: Haplotypes 1 (1221), 2 (1222), 6 (2111), and 7 (2221) increase the risk of being a carrier from 1 in 55 (haplotype 6) to 1 in 17 (haplotype 1), whereas haplotypes 3 (1122), 4 (1112), 8 (2222) and 10 (1111) lower the risk from 1 in 144 (haplotype 3) to 1 in 1678 (haplotype 10). Moreover, the mutation R553X shows strong correlation with haplotype 3, leading to the suggestion that haplotypes 1, 2, 5, and 6 may account for four additional mutations in Switzerland.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Twenty-two patients with confirmed diagnosis of DMD were interviewed at two Neurology Centers (Mexican Social Security Institute) in Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico. Two forms of onset of DMD: Retarded development and locomotion problems were found, confirming other studies. The mean age of onset of symptoms for 22 patients was 2.4 years. The mean age for DMD diagnosis was 4.9 years. Retarded development occurred in 12 (54.4%) of all cases and the age of diagnosis was between 1 and 6 years of age. In 10 cases of the group with locomotion problems (45.4%) the diagnosis was made between 3 and 11 years of age. The serum Creatine Kinase was increased in all patients and in the early stages these levels were much higher than late stages. Family physicians have opportunities to make early diagnosis of DMD if they are aware of the two forms of onset of the disease: Retarded development and locomotion problems and of the changes in serum CK levels. The findings of this study confirm the importance of family physicians in that respect and also in making recommendations for routine determination of serum Creatine Kinase (CK) as early as possible in a child with symptoms suggestive of DMD."

In 2009, a study from the Muscular Dystrophy Surveillance, Tracking, and Research Network (MD STARnet) showed an average diagnosis age of 5\u2009years among males with DMD born from January 1, 1982 to December 31, 2000. Initiatives were implemented by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and patient organizations to reduce time to diagnosis. We conducted a follow-up study in a surveillance cohort born after January 1, 2000 to determine whether there has been an improvement in time to diagnosis.\nMETHODS: We assessed the age of diagnosis among males with DMD born from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2015 using data collected by six US MD STARnet surveillance sites (Colorado, Iowa, western New York State, the Piedmont region of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Utah). The analytic cohort included 221 males with definite or probable DMD diagnosis without a documented family history. We computed frequency count and percentage for categorical variables, and mean, median, and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables.\nRESULTS: The mean [median] ages in years of diagnostic milestones were: first signs, 2.7 [2.0]; first creatine kinase (CK), 4.6 [4.6]; DNA/muscle biopsy testing, 4.9 [4.8]; and time from first signs to diagnostic confirmation, 2.2 [1.4].\nDISCUSSION: The time interval between first signs of DMD and diagnosis remains unchanged at 2.2\u2009years. This results in lost opportunities for timely genetic counseling, implementation of standards of care, initiation of glucocorticoids, and participation in clinical trials."

They were asked to record their time to first response and complete resolution following the treatment. This cohort included our most severely affected and difficult to treat patients.\nRESULTS: In most cases, time to first improvement following rhC1INH and complete resolution was recorded as comparable to their typical response to pdC1INH, although 4/11 patients reported that the time to first improvement was much quicker than their average pdC1INH response. Five of the 11 patients continued with rhC1INH as their preferred rescue treatment. Of those who chose not to continue the treatment, four reported a recurrence or early return of symptoms with rhC1INH.\nCONCLUSION: In our experience, rhC1INH is a beneficial treatment for patients with preference for a C1INH that is not plasma derived and it is suitable for home treatment. In some cases it demonstrates cost saving, especially for heavier patients who require higher doses. In some patients rhC1INH may result in faster resolution of symptoms.

Based on preclinical data, migalastat HCl in combination with agalsidase is expected to result in the pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancement of agalsidase in plasma by increasing the systemic exposure of active agalsidase, thereby leading to increased cellular levels in disease-relevant tissues. This Phase 2a study design consisted of an open-label, fixed-treatment sequence that evaluated the effects of single oral doses of 150 mg or 450 mg migalastat HCl on the PK and tissue levels of intravenously infused agalsidase (0.2, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg) in male Fabry patients. As expected, intravenous administration of agalsidase alone resulted in increased \u03b1-Gal A activity in plasma, skin, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) compared to baseline. Following co-administration of migalastat HCl and agalsidase, \u03b1-Gal A activity in plasma was further significantly increased 1.2- to 5.1-fold compared to agalsidase administration alone, in 22 of 23 patients (95.6%). Importantly, similar increases in skin and PBMC \u03b1-Gal A activity were seen following co-administration of migalastat HCl and agalsidase. The effects were not related to the administered migalastat HCl dose, as the 150 mg dose of migalastat HCl increased \u03b1-Gal A activity to the same extent as the 450 mg dose.

It is important for the practicing pediatrician, however, to be aware of other presenting signs, such as delayed motor or cognitive milestones, or elevated serum transaminases. Becker muscular dystrophy is milder, often presenting after age 5, with ambulation frequently preserved past 20 years and sometimes into late decades."

Lower body muscle weakness progresses to non-ambulation typically by early teenage years, followed by upper body muscle deterioration and ultimately death by the late twenties. The objective of this study was to enhance the quantitative understanding of DMD disease progression through nonlinear mixed effects modeling of the population mean and variability of the 6-min walk test (6MWT) clinical endpoint. An indirect response model with a latent process was fit to digitized literature data using full Bayesian estimation. The modeling data set consisted of 22 healthy controls and 218 DMD patients from one interventional and four observational trials. The model reasonably described the central tendency and population variability of the 6MWT in healthy subjects and DMD patients. An exploratory categorical covariate analysis indicated that there was no apparent effect of corticosteroid administration on DMD disease progression. The population predicted 6MWT began to rise at 1.32 years of age, plateauing at 654 meters (m) at 17.2 years of age for the healthy population. The DMD trajectory reached a maximum of 411 m at 8.90 years before declining and falling below 1 m at age 18.0. The model has potential to be used as a Bayesian estimation and posterior simulation tool to make informed model-based drug development decisions that incorporate prior knowledge with new data."

To fully characterize the natural history, it is crucial to obtain appropriate estimates of the life expectancy and mortality rates of patients with DMD.\nMETHODS: A systematic review of the published literature on mortality in DMD up to July 2020 was undertaken, specifically focusing on publications in which Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves with age as a timescale were presented. These were digitized, and individual patient data (IPD) were reconstructed. The pooled IPD were analyzed with the KM estimator and parametric survival analysis models. Estimates were also stratified by birth cohort.\nRESULTS: Of 1,177 articles identified, 14 publications met the inclusion criteria and provided data on 2,283 patients, of whom 1,049 had died. Median life expectancy was 22.0 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 21.2, 22.4). Analyses stratified by 3 time periods in which patients were born showed markedly increased life expectancy in more recent patient populations; patients born after 1990 have a median life expectancy of 28.1 years (95% CI 25.1, 30.3).\nDISCUSSION: This article presents a full overview of mortality across the lifetime of a patient with DMD and highlights recent improvements in survival. In the absence of large-scale prospective cohort studies or trials reporting mortality data for patients with DMD, extraction of IPD from the literature provides a viable alternative to estimating life expectancy for this patient population."

The aim of this nationwide study was to explore the prevalence, life expectancy and leading causes of death in patients with DMD in Sweden. Patients with DMD were identified through the National Quality Registry for Neuromuscular Diseases in Sweden, the Swedish Registry of Respiratory Failure, pathology laboratories, neurology and respiratory clinics, and the national network for neuromuscular diseases. Age and cause of death were retrieved from the Cause of Death Registry and cross-checked with medical records. 373 DMD patients born 1970-2019 were identified, of whom 129 patients deceased during the study period. Point prevalence of adult patients with DMD on December 31st 2019 was 3.2 per 100,000 adult males. Birth prevalence was 19.2 per 100,000 male births. Median survival was 29.9\u00a0years, the leading cause of death being cardiopulmonary in 79.9% of patients. Non-cardiopulmonary causes of death (20.1% of patients) mainly pertained to injury-related pulmonary embolism (1.3 per 1000 person-years), gastrointestinal complications (1.0 per 1000 person-years), stroke (0.6 per 1000 person-years) and unnatural deaths (1.6 per 1000 person-years). Death from non-cardiopulmonary causes occurred at younger ages (mean 21.0\u00a0years, SD 8.2; p\u2009=\u20090.004). Age at loss of independent ambulation did not have significant impact on overall survival (p\u2009=\u20090.26).

It is potentially fatal, particularly if not identified at an early stage. Apart from androgens, which are contraindicated in children and in pregnant women, a range of effective, albeit very expensive treatments have recently become available for HAE patients. The cost of these new treatments is beyond the reach of most developing countries. At this time, there is no cure for the disorder. In spite of mutations of the SERPING1 gene, autoimmunity and infections are not prominent features of the condition. Here, we present the argument that HAE should be viewed primarily as a metabolic liver disorder. This conceptual paradigm shift will stimulate basic research and may facilitate new therapeutic approaches to HAE outlined in this paper. We suggest several novel potential treatment options for HAE from the perspectives of clinical immunology, molecular biology, and liver transplantation. Many of these offer the prospect of curing the disorder. The effectiveness of these options is rapidly improving in many cases, and their risks are decreasing. Given the very high costs of treating HAE, some of these curative options may become feasible in the next decade."

These attacks are mediated by excessive bradykinin production, as a result of uncontrolled activation of the plasma kallikrein/kinin system, which is caused by a C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency or dysfunction in HAE types 1 and 2, respectively. For many years, treatment options were limited to therapies with substantial adverse effects, insufficient efficacy, or difficult routes of administration. Increased insights in the pathophysiology of HAE have paved the way for the development of new therapies with fewer side effects. In the last two decades, several targeted novel therapeutic strategies for HAE have been developed, for both long-term prophylaxis and on demand treatment of acute attacks. This article reviews the advances in the development of more effective and convenient treatment options for HAE and their anticipated effects on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. The emergence of these improved treatment options will presumably change current HAE guidelines, but adherence to these recommendations may become restricted by high treatment costs. It will therefore be essential to determine the indications and identify the patients that will benefit most from these newest treatment generations. Ultimately, current preclinical research into gene therapies may eventually lead the way towards curative treatment options for HAE. In conclusion, an increasing shift towards the use of highly effective long-term prophylaxis is anticipated, which should drastically abate the burden on patients with hereditary angioedema."

Almost all cases of HAE are caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene resulting in a deficiency in functional plasma C1 esterase inhibitor (C1EI), a serine protease inhibitor that normally inhibits proteases in the contact, complement, and fibrinolytic systems. Current treatment of HAE includes long-term prophylaxis with attenuated androgens or human plasma-derived C1EI and management of acute attacks with human plasma-derived or recombinant C1EI, bradykinin, and kallikrein inhibitors, each of which requires repeated administration. As an approach to effectively treat HAE with a single treatment, we hypothesized that a one-time intravenous administration of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene transfer vector expressing the genetic sequence of the normal human C1 esterase inhibitor (AAVrh.10hC1EI) would provide sustained circulating C1EI levels sufficient to prevent angioedema episodes.\nMETHODS: To study the efficacy of AAVrh.10hC1EI, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to create a heterozygote C1EI-deficient mouse model (S63\u00b1) that shares characteristics associated with HAE in humans including decreased plasma C1EI and C4 levels. Phenotypically, these mice have increased vascular permeability of skin and internal organs.\nRESULTS: Systemic administration of AAVrh.10hC1EI to the S63\u00b1 mice resulted in sustained human C1EI activity levels above the predicted therapeutic levels and correction of the vascular leak in skin and internal organs.\nCONCLUSION: A single treatment with AAVrh.10hC1EI has the potential to provide long-term protection from angioedema attacks in affected individuals."

Almost all cases of HAE are caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene resulting in a deficiency in functional plasma C1 esterase inhibitor (C1EI), a serine protease inhibitor that normally inhibits proteases in the contact, complement, and fibrinolytic systems. Current treatment of HAE includes long-term prophylaxis with attenuated androgens or human plasma-derived C1EI and management of acute attacks with human plasma-derived or recombinant C1EI, bradykinin, and kallikrein inhibitors, each of which requires repeated administration. As an approach to effectively treat HAE with a single treatment, we hypothesized that a one-time intravenous administration of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene transfer vector expressing the genetic sequence of the normal human C1 esterase inhibitor (AAVrh.10hC1EI) would provide sustained circulating C1EI levels sufficient to prevent angioedema episodes.\nMETHODS: To study the efficacy of AAVrh.10hC1EI, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to create a heterozygote C1EI-deficient mouse model (S63\u00b1) that shares characteristics associated with HAE in humans including decreased plasma C1EI and C4 levels. Phenotypically, these mice have increased vascular permeability of skin and internal organs.\nRESULTS: Systemic administration of AAVrh.10hC1EI to the S63\u00b1 mice resulted in sustained human C1EI activity levels above the predicted therapeutic levels and correction of the vascular leak in skin and internal organs.\nCONCLUSION: A single treatment with AAVrh.10hC1EI has the potential to provide long-term protection from angioedema attacks in affected individuals."

Loss-of-function of PAH leads to accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood/body of an untreated patient, which damages the developing brain, causing severe mental retardation. Current gene therapy strategies based on adeno-associated vector (AAV) delivery of PAH gene were effective in male animals but had little long-term effects on blood hyperphenylalaninemia in females. Here, we designed a gene therapy strategy using AAV to deliver a human codon-optimized phenylalanine amino lyase in a liver-specific manner. It was shown that PAL was active in lysing phenylalanine when it was expressed in mammalian cells. We produced a recombinant adeno-associated vector serotype 8 (AAV8) viral vector expressing the humanized PAL under the control of human antitrypsin (hAAT) promoter (AAV8-PAL). A single intravenous administration of AAV8-PAL caused long-term correction of hyperphenylalaninemia in both male and female PKU mice (strain Pahenu2). Besides, no obvious liver injury was observed throughout the treatment process. Thus, our results established that AAV-mediated liver delivery of PAL gene is a promising strategy in the treatment of PKU."

Cardiac dysfunction and respiratory muscle weakness are primary features of this disorder. To attenuate the progressive and rapid accumulation of glycogen resulting in cardiorespiratory dysfunction, adult Gaa (-/-) mice were administered a single systemic injection of rAAV2/9-DES-hGAA (AAV9-DES) or bimonthly injections of recombinant human GAA (enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)). Assessment of cardiac function and morphology was measured 1 and 3 months after initiation of treatment while whole-body plethysmography and diaphragmatic contractile function was evaluated at 3 months post-treatment in all groups. Gaa (-/-) animals receiving either AAV9-DES or ERT demonstrated a significant improvement in cardiac function and diaphragmatic contractile function as compared to control animals. AAV9-DES treatment resulted in a significant reduction in cardiac dimension (end diastolic left ventricular mass/gram wet weight; EDMc) at 3 months postinjection. Neither AAV nor ERT therapy altered minute ventilation during quiet breathing (eupnea). However, breathing frequency and expiratory time were significantly improved in AAV9-DES animals. These results indicate systemic delivery of either strategy improves cardiac function but AAV9-DES alone improves respiratory parameters at 3 months post-treatment in a murine model of Pompe disease."

            "response": "There are four types of Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which are classified based on the age of onset and the severity of the symptoms. Type I is the most severe form, also known as Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, which appears before the age of 6 months. Type II is less severe and appears between 6 and 18 months. Type III, also known as Kugelberg-Welander disease, appears between 18 months and 3 years. Type IV is the mildest form, which appears in adulthood.\n\nQuestion: What are the symptoms of Spinal Muscular Atrophy?\n\nAnswer: The symptoms of Spinal Muscular Atrophy include muscle weakness, muscle wasting, and loss of motor skills. The symptoms can vary depending on the type of SMA and the age of onset. In general, the symptoms include difficulty walking, running, and climbing stairs, as well as muscle weakness in the arms and legs.\n\nQuestion: What is the cause of Spinal Muscular Atrophy?\n\nAnswer: Spinal Muscular Atrophy is caused by a genetic mutation in the SMN1 gene, which codes for the survival motor neuron protein. This protein is essential for the survival of motor neurons, which are responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement. The mutation leads to a deficiency of the SMN protein, which causes the motor neurons to die, resulting in muscle weakness and wasting.\n\nQuestion: How is Spinal Muscular Atrophy diagnosed?\n\nAnswer: Spinal Muscular Atrophy is diagnosed through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and genetic testing. The diagnosis is typically confirmed through genetic testing, which can detect the mutation in the SMN1 gene.\n\nQuestion: What is the treatment for Spinal Muscular Atrophy?\n\nAnswer: There is no cure for Spinal Muscular Atrophy, but various treatments can help manage the symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. These treatments include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy, as well as medications to manage muscle spasms and pain. In recent years, several new treatments have been approved, including Spinraza (nusinersen) and Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec), which have shown promising results in slowing down the progression of the disease.",

Now we examined 7 cases of type I and 9 cases of type II on clinical and histochemical ground. Of the total of 16 cases, 5 cases had a family history of the disease. (1) In type I, three were males and 4 females. The onset was within 30 days and the disease was manifest before or at delivery in 3 cases. The progression was so severe. All cases were dead by 10 months. They showed generalized hypotonia, abnormal respiration and could not sit without support. In type II, five were males and 4 females. The onset of the disease was between the age of 3 and 15 months. The progression was slow. All patients couldn't walk by themselves at all but 7 of them had abilities to sit without support. Clinically it was easy to classify type I from type II. (2) The most characteristic histochemical findings of both types were group atrophy, fiber hypertrophy, fiber type predominance and fibrosis. Though there was a slight difference between two types in histological pattern, the basis was so similar. There is controversy about the proper classification of recessive childhood SMA.

At present it seems likely that childhood onset SMA represents a broad spectrum of various ages of onset and different degrees of disability. Apart from different modes of inheritance, there is further evidence of heterogeneity in proximal SMA. The autosomal recessive forms represent the second frequent recessive disorder after cystic fibrosis, whereas autosomal dominant inheritance is an exception in childhood onset SMA. There are no convincing reports of X-linked SMA hitherto.

Clinical heterogeneity is pervasive: three infantile (type I-III) and one adult-onset (type IV) forms are recognized. Type I SMA is the most common genetic cause of death in infancy and accounts for about 50% of all patients with SMA. Most forms of SMA are caused by mutations of the survival motor neuron (SMN1) gene. A second gene that is 99% identical to SMN1 (SMN2) is located in the same region. The only functionally relevant difference between the two genes identified to date is a C\u2009\u2192\u2009T transition in exon 7 of SMN2, which determines an alternative spliced isoform that predominantly excludes exon 7. Thus, SMN2 genes do not produce sufficient full length SMN protein to prevent the onset of the disease. Since the identification of the causative mutation, biomedical research of SMA has progressed by leaps and bounds: from clues on the function of SMN protein, to the development of different models of the disease, to the identification of potential treatments, some of which are currently in human trials. The aim of this review is to elucidate the current state of knowledge, emphasizing how close we are to the solution of the puzzle that is SMA, and, more importantly, to highlight the missing pieces of this puzzle. Filling in these gaps in our knowledge will likely accelerate the development and delivery of efficient treatments for SMA patients and be a prerequisite towards achieving our final goal, the cure of SMA."

Clinical heterogeneity is pervasive: three infantile (type I-III) and one adult-onset (type IV) forms are recognized. Type I SMA is the most common genetic cause of death in infancy and accounts for about 50% of all patients with SMA. Most forms of SMA are caused by mutations of the survival motor neuron (SMN1) gene. A second gene that is 99% identical to SMN1 (SMN2) is located in the same region. The only functionally relevant difference between the two genes identified to date is a C\u2009\u2192\u2009T transition in exon 7 of SMN2, which determines an alternative spliced isoform that predominantly excludes exon 7. Thus, SMN2 genes do not produce sufficient full length SMN protein to prevent the onset of the disease. Since the identification of the causative mutation, biomedical research of SMA has progressed by leaps and bounds: from clues on the function of SMN protein, to the development of different models of the disease, to the identification of potential treatments, some of which are currently in human trials. The aim of this review is to elucidate the current state of knowledge, emphasizing how close we are to the solution of the puzzle that is SMA, and, more importantly, to highlight the missing pieces of this puzzle. Filling in these gaps in our knowledge will likely accelerate the development and delivery of efficient treatments for SMA patients and be a prerequisite towards achieving our final goal, the cure of SMA."

The disease has been classified into three types based on age of onset and severity. SMA I-III all map to chromosome 5q13 (refs 2,3), and nearly all patients display deletions or gene conversions of the survival motor neuron (SMN1) gene. Some correlation has been established between SMN protein levels and disease course; nevertheless, the genetic basis for SMA phenotypic variability remains unclear, and it has been postulated that the loss of an additional modifying factor contributes to the severity of type I SMA. Using comparative genomics to screen for such a factor among evolutionarily conserved sequences between mouse and human, we have identified a novel transcript, H4F5, which lies closer to SMN1 than any previously identified gene in the region. A multi-copy microsatellite marker that is deleted in more than 90% of type I SMA chromosomes is embedded in an intron of this gene, indicating that H4F5 is also highly deleted in type I SMA chromosomes, and thus is a candidate phenotypic modifier for SMA."

There are no convincing reports of X-linked SMA hitherto. With mapping of acute and chronic forms of childhood SMA to chromosome 5q11.2-13.3 diagnosis by use of DNA markers in affected families has become available.

All cases were dead by 10 months. They showed generalized hypotonia, abnormal respiration and could not sit without support. In type II, five were males and 4 females. The onset of the disease was between the age of 3 and 15 months. The progression was slow. All patients couldn't walk by themselves at all but 7 of them had abilities to sit without support. Clinically it was easy to classify type I from type II. (2) The most characteristic histochemical findings of both types were group atrophy, fiber hypertrophy, fiber type predominance and fibrosis. Though there was a slight difference between two types in histological pattern, the basis was so similar. There is controversy about the proper classification of recessive childhood SMA.

SMA disease severity ranges from extremely severe to a relatively mild adult onset form of proximal muscle atrophy. Severe SMA patients typically die mostly within months or a few years as a consequence of respiratory insufficiency and bulbar paralysis. SMA is widely known as a motor neuron disease; however, there are numerous clinical reports indicating the involvement of additional peripheral organs contributing to the complete picture of the disease in severe cases. In this review, we have compiled clinical and experimental reports that demonstrate the association between the loss of SMN and peripheral organ deficiency and malfunction.

Currently, there is no cure, though exon-skipping therapy including eteplirsen (brand name Exondys 51), a synthetic antisense oligonucleotide designed to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene, is considered especially promising. Applicable to approximately 14% of DMD patients, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) antisense oligonucleotide eteplirsen received accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016. Throughout clinical trials, eteplirsen has been well tolerated by patients with no serious drug-related adverse events. The most common events observed are balance disorder, vomiting, and skin rash. Despite its safety and promise of functional benefits, eteplirsen remains controversial due to its low production of dystrophin. In addition, unmodified PMOs have limited efficacy in the heart. To address these concerns of efficacy, eteplirsen has been conjugated to a proprietary cell-penetrating peptide; the conjugate is called SRP-5051. Compared to eteplirsen, SRP-5051 aims to better prompt exon-skipping and dystrophin production but may have greater toxicity concerns. This paper reviews and discusses the available information on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability data of eteplirsen and SRP-5051 from preclinical and clinical trials. Issues faced by eteplirsen and SRP-5051, including efficacy and safety, are identified. Lastly, the current state of eteplirsen and exon-skipping therapy in general as a strategy for the treatment of DMD are discussed."

Typically, DMD patients pass away from heart failure or respiratory failure. Currently, there is no cure, though exon-skipping therapy including eteplirsen (brand name Exondys 51), a synthetic antisense oligonucleotide designed to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene, is considered especially promising. Applicable to approximately 14% of DMD patients, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) antisense oligonucleotide eteplirsen received accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016. Throughout clinical trials, eteplirsen has been well tolerated by patients with no serious drug-related adverse events. The most common events observed are balance disorder, vomiting, and skin rash. Despite its safety and promise of functional benefits, eteplirsen remains controversial due to its low production of dystrophin. In addition, unmodified PMOs have limited efficacy in the heart. To address these concerns of efficacy, eteplirsen has been conjugated to a proprietary cell-penetrating peptide; the conjugate is called SRP-5051. Compared to eteplirsen, SRP-5051 aims to better prompt exon-skipping and dystrophin production but may have greater toxicity concerns. This paper reviews and discusses the available information on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability data of eteplirsen and SRP-5051 from preclinical and clinical trials. Issues faced by eteplirsen and SRP-5051, including efficacy and safety, are identified. Lastly, the current state of eteplirsen and exon-skipping therapy in general as a strategy for the treatment of DMD are discussed."

A relationship between exon skipping and dystrophin production in exon 51-amenable patients treated with eteplirsen (EXONDYS 51\u00ae) is established. Once-weekly eteplirsen significantly increased dystrophin, with slower decline in ambulatory function compared to baseline. Long-term treatment with eteplirsen leads to accumulation of dystrophin over time and observed functional benefits in patients with DMD.\nOBJECTIVE: Compare long-term ambulatory function in eteplirsen-treated patients versus controls.\nMETHODS: Study 201/202 included 12 eteplirsen-treated patients assessed twice/year for ambulatory function over 4 years. Ambulatory evaluations (6-minute walk test [6MWT], loss of ambulation, and North Star Ambulatory Assessment [NSAA]) were compared with matched controls from Italian Telethon and Leuven registries.\nRESULTS: At Years 3 and 4, eteplirsen-treated patients demonstrated markedly greater mean 6MWT than controls (difference in change from baseline of 132 m [95%CI (29, 235), p\u200a=\u200a0.015] at Year 3 and 159\u200am [95%CI (66, 253), p\u200a=\u200a0.002] at Year 4). At Year 4, a significantly greater proportion of eteplirsen-treated patients were still ambulant versus controls (10/12 vs 3/11; p\u200a=\u200a0.020). At Year 3, eteplirsen-treated patients demonstrated milder NSAA decline versus controls (difference in change from baseline of 2.6, 95%CI [-6, 11]), however, the difference was not statistically significant; Year 4 control NSAA data were not available.\nCONCLUSION: In this retrospective matched control study, eteplirsen treatment resulted in attenuation of ambulatory decline over a 4-year observation period, supporting long-term benefit in patients with DMD."

We now show that this dystrophin expression was accompanied by an elevated expression of \u03b1-sarcoglycan, \u03b2-dystroglycan (BDG) and--in relevant cases--neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) at the sarcolemma, each of which is a component of a different subcomplex of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DAPC). As expected, nNOS expression was relocalized to the sarcolemma in Duchenne patients in whom the dystrophin deletion left the nNOS-binding domain (exons 42-45) intact, whereas this did not occur in patients with deletions that involved this domain. Our results indicate that the novel internally deleted and shorter dystrophin induced by skipping exon 51 in patients with amenable deletions, can also restore the dystrophin-associated complex, further suggesting preserved functionality of the newly translated dystrophin."

Part 1 primary endpoint was safety. Part 2 primary endpoints were dystrophin protein expression and 6-minute walk test (6MWT); secondary endpoints were percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%p) and safety.

What advances does it highlight? Over the last two decades, considerable progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying Duchenne muscular dystrophy, leading to the development of genetic therapies. These include manipulation of the expression of the gene or related genes, the splicing of the gene and its translation, and replacement of the gene using viral approaches. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a lethal X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. In the absence of the dystrophin protein, the link between the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix is destroyed, and this severely compromises the strength, flexibility and stability of muscle fibres. The devastating consequence is progressive muscle wasting and premature death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. There is currently no cure, and despite exhaustive palliative care, patients are restricted to a wheelchair by the age of 12 years and usually succumb to cardiac or respiratory complications in their late 20s. This review provides an update on the current genetically based therapies and clinical trials that target or compensate for the primary defect of this disease. These include dystrophin gene-replacement strategies, genetic modification techniques to restore dystrophin expression, and modulation of the dystrophin homologue, utrophin, as a surrogate to re-establish muscle function."

Genetic confirmation has become standard in recent years. Improvements in the standard of care for DMD have led to improved survival. Novel treatments for DMD have focused on reducing the dystrophic mechanism of the muscle disease, modulating utrophin protein expression, and restoring dystrophin protein expression. Among the strategies to reduce the dystrophic mechanisms are 1) inhibiting inflammation, 2) promoting muscle growth and regeneration, 3) reducing fibrosis, and 4) facilitating mitochondrial function. The agents under investigation include a novel steroid, myostatin inhibitors, idebenone, an anti-CTGF antibody, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, and cardiosphere-derived cells. For utrophin modulation, AAV-mediated gene therapy with GALGT2 is currently being investigated to upregulate utrophin expression. Finally, the strategies for dystrophin protein restoration include 1) nonsense readthrough, 2) synthetic antisense oligonucleotides for exon skipping, and 3) AAV-mediated micro/minidystrophin gene delivery. With newer agents, we are witnessing the use of more advanced biotechnological methods.

The time to rise from the floor ranged from 1 to 27.5 s. Some patients were unable to rise from the floor. As expected the results changed with age and were overall better in children treated with daily steroids. The North Star assessment had a moderate to good correlation with 6-minute walk test and with timed rising from floor but less with 10 m timed walk/run test. The 6-minute walk test in contrast had better correlation with 10 m timed walk/run test than with timed rising from floor.

All analyses were performed using the Rasch Unidimensional Measurement Model.\nRESULTS: Overall, Rasch analysis supported the NSAA as being a reliable (high Person Separation Index of 0.91) and valid (good targeting, little misfit, no reversed thresholds) measure of ambulatory function in DMD. One item displayed misfit (lifts head, fit residual 6.9) and there was evidence for some local dependency (stand on right/left leg, climb and descend box step right/left leg, and hop on right/left leg, residual correlations >0.40), which we provide potential solutions for in future use of the NSAA. Importantly, our findings supported good clinical validity in that the hierarchy of items within the scale produced by the analyses was supported by clinical opinion, thus increasing the clinical interpretability of scale scores.\nINTERPRETATION: In general, Rasch analysis supported the NSAA as a psychometrically robust scale for use in DMD clinical research and trials. This study also demonstrates how Rasch analysis is a useful instrument to detect and understand the key measurement issues of rating scales."

Part 1 was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-titration study followed by 9-week safety review. Part 2 was a 168-week, open-label evaluation of golodirsen 30\u2009mg/kg. Part 1 primary endpoint was safety. Part 2 primary endpoints were dystrophin protein expression and 6-minute walk test (6MWT); secondary endpoints were percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%p) and safety. Post hoc ambulation analyses used mutation-matched external natural history controls. All patients from Part 1 (golodirsen, n\u2009=\u20098; placebo, n\u2009=\u20094) plus 13 additional patients entered Part 2; 23 completed the study. Adverse events were generally mild, nonserious, and unrelated to golodirsen, with no safety-related discontinuations or deaths. Golodirsen increased dystrophin protein (16.0-fold; P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001) and exon skipping (28.9-fold; P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). At 3 years, 6MWT change from baseline was -99.0\u2009m for golodirsen-treated patients versus -181.4\u2009m for external controls (P\u2009=\u20090.067), and loss of ambulation occurred in 9% versus 26% (P\u2009=\u20090.21). FVC%p declined 8.4% over 3 years in golodirsen-treated patients, comparing favorably with literature-reported rates. This study provides evidence for golodirsen biologic activity and long-term safety in a declining DMD population and suggests functional benefit versus external controls.

Loss-of-function mutations in the DMD gene, which codes for dystrophin, lead to this disease. The majority of mutations in this gene result in the exclusion of one or more exons from the transcript, eventually causing the remaining exons not to fit together correctly (i.e., out-of-frame mutations). Antisense oligonucleotides, e.g., phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), can induce therapeutic exon skipping during pre-mRNA processing to restore the reading frame of the primary transcript of DMD. As a result, truncated but partially functional dystrophin is produced, potentially slowing down the disease progression. Golodirsen is a provisionally approved PMO-based drug for approx. 8% of all DMD patients amenable to exon 53 skipping. This article summarizes golodirsen's pharmacology, efficacy and safety information. It also discusses some controversies that golodirsen met after the approval."

Typically, DMD patients pass away from heart failure or respiratory failure. Currently, there is no cure, though exon-skipping therapy including eteplirsen (brand name Exondys 51), a synthetic antisense oligonucleotide designed to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene, is considered especially promising. Applicable to approximately 14% of DMD patients, a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) antisense oligonucleotide eteplirsen received accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016. Throughout clinical trials, eteplirsen has been well tolerated by patients with no serious drug-related adverse events. The most common events observed are balance disorder, vomiting, and skin rash. Despite its safety and promise of functional benefits, eteplirsen remains controversial due to its low production of dystrophin. In addition, unmodified PMOs have limited efficacy in the heart. To address these concerns of efficacy, eteplirsen has been conjugated to a proprietary cell-penetrating peptide; the conjugate is called SRP-5051. Compared to eteplirsen, SRP-5051 aims to better prompt exon-skipping and dystrophin production but may have greater toxicity concerns. This paper reviews and discusses the available information on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability data of eteplirsen and SRP-5051 from preclinical and clinical trials. Issues faced by eteplirsen and SRP-5051, including efficacy and safety, are identified. Lastly, the current state of eteplirsen and exon-skipping therapy in general as a strategy for the treatment of DMD are discussed."

Viltolarsen, an exon 53 skipping therapy, has been shown to increase endogenous dystrophin levels. Herein, long-term (>2 years) functional outcomes in viltolarsen treated patients were compared to a matched historical control group.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term efficacy and safety of the anti-sense oligonucleotide viltolarsen in the treatment of patients with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping therapy.\nMETHODS: This trial (NCT03167255) is the extension of a previously published 24-week trial in North America (NCT02740972) that examined dystrophin levels, timed function tests compared to a matched historical control group (Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group Duchenne Natural History Study, CINRG DNHS), and safety in boys 4 to\u200a<\u200a10 years (N\u200a=\u200a16) with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping who were treated with viltolarsen. Both groups were treated with glucocorticoids. All 16 participants elected to enroll in this long-term trial (up to 192 weeks) to continue evaluation of motor function and safety.\nRESULTS: Time to stand from supine and time to run/walk 10 meters showed stabilization from baseline through week 109 for viltolarsen-treated participants whereas the historical control group showed decline (statistically significant differences for multiple timepoints). Safety was similar to that observed in the previous 24-week trial, which was predominantly mild. There have been no treatment-related serious adverse events and no discontinuations.\nCONCLUSIONS: Based on these results at over 2 years, viltolarsen can be a new treatment option for patients with DMD amenable to exon 53 skipping."

Glucocorticoids such as prednisone and deflazacort have powerful anti-inflammatory benefits and are the standard of care for DMD, but their long-term use can result in severe adverse side effects; thus, vamorolone was designed as a unique dissociative steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, to retain efficacy and minimise these adverse effects. Extensive clinical trials (ongoing) have investigated the use of vamorolone for DMD, with two trials also for limb-girdle muscular dystrophies including dysferlinopathy (current), plus a variety of pre-clinical trials published. Vamorolone looks very promising, with similar efficacy and some reduced adverse effects (e.g., related to height) compared with other glucocorticoids, specifically prednisone/prednisolone, although it has not yet been directly compared with deflazacort. Of particular interest to clarify is the optimal clinical dose and other aspects of vamorolone that are proposed to provide additional benefits for membranes of dystrophic muscle: to stabilise and protect the sarcolemma from damage and enhance repair. The use of vamorolone (and other glucocorticoids) needs to be evaluated in terms of overall long-term efficacy and cost, and also in comparison with many candidate non-steroidal drugs with anti-inflammatory and other benefits for DMD."

This phase II, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, three-period study with 6 months open-label follow-up enrolled adults with ALS and sitting slow vital capacity (SVC) 60%-90 % of predicted from 11 sites in four countries.\nMETHODS: Patients received levosimendan 1\u2009mg daily, 1\u2009mg two times a day or placebo during three 14-day crossover periods and levosimendan 1-2\u2009mg daily during open-label follow-up. Primary endpoint was sitting SVC; secondary endpoints included supine SVC, ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), tolerability and safety.\nRESULTS: Of 66 patients randomised, 59 contributed to the double-blind results and 50 entered open-label follow-up. Sitting SVC was not significantly different between the treatments. In post hoc analysis using period-wise baselines, supine SVC favoured levosimendan over placebo, estimated mean differences from baseline being -3.62% on placebo, +0.77% on levosimendan 1\u2009mg daily (p=0.018) and +2.38% on 1\u2009mg two times a day (p=0.001). Headache occurred in 16.7% of patients during levosimendan 1\u2009mg daily (p=0.030), 28.6% during 1\u2009mg two times a day (p=0.002) and 3.3% during placebo. The respective frequencies for increased heart rate were 5.1% (p=0.337), 18.5% (p=0.018) and 1.7%. No significant differences between the treatments were seen for other adverse events.\nCONCLUSIONS: Levosimendan did not achieve the primary endpoint of improving sitting SVC in ALS. Headache and increased heart rate were increased on levosimendan, although it was otherwise well tolerated. A phase III study to evaluate the longer term effects of oral levosimendan in ALS is ongoing."

Participants were followed up between June 27, 2018 and June 26, 2020, for a median duration of 50\u00b71 (IQR 37\u00b75-51\u00b71) weeks. The median duration of treatment was 47\u00b79 (IQR 26\u00b74-48\u00b71) weeks. Change from baseline in supine SVC at 12 weeks was -6\u00b773% with levosimendan and -6\u00b799% with placebo, with no significant difference between the treatments (estimated treatment difference 0\u00b726%, 95% CI -2\u00b703 to 2\u00b755, p=0\u00b783).

The most frequent adverse events were increased heart rate (106 [33%] of 326 receiving levosimendan vs 12 [7%] of 166 receiving placebo), fall (85 [26%] vs 48 [29%]), headache (93 [29%] vs 36 [22%]), and dyspnoea (59 [18%] vs 32 [19%]). 33 (10%) participants allocated levosimendan and 20 (12%) assigned placebo died during the trial, mainly due to respiratory failure or progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\nINTERPRETATION: Levosimendan was not superior to placebo in maintaining respiratory function in a broad population with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although levosimendan was generally well tolerated, increased heart rate and headache occurred more frequently with levosimendan than with placebo.

In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, levosimendan, a calcium sensitiser, was shown to improve neuromechanical efficiency and contractile function of the human diaphragm. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral levosimendan in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, with a focus on respiratory function.\nMETHODS: The REFALS study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial at 99 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis specialist centres in 14 countries worldwide. People with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were eligible for participation if they were at least 18 years of age and had a sitting slow vital capacity (SVC) of 60-90% predicted. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) by interactive web-response system to receive either levosimendan or placebo. The capsules for oral administration were identical in appearance to maintain blinding of participants and investigators. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in supine SVC at 12 weeks, assessed as the percentage of predicted normal sitting SVC. The key secondary endpoint was the combined assessment of function and survival (CAFS) up to 48 weeks. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, comprising all participants who were randomly assigned. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03505021) and has been completed. An extension study (REFALS-ES; NCT03948178) has also been completed, but will be reported separately."

Patients with clinically probable or definite ALS of more than 6 months and less than 5 years duration were randomly assigned to placebo, 1 mg or 2 mg xaliproden orally once daily as monotherapy in Study 1 (n=867); or to the same regimen with addition of riluzole 50 mg bid background therapy in Study 2 (n=1210 patients). The two primary endpoints were defined as: 1. Time to death, tracheostomy, or permanent assisted ventilation (DTP), and 2. Time to vital capacity (VC)<50% or DTP before (log-rank test) and after adjustment using a Cox proportional hazard model for prespecified prognostic factors. Secondary endpoints were rates of change of various functional measures. In Study 1, primary outcome measures did not reach statistical significance. For the 2 mg group, for time to VC<50% analysis (without DTP) a significant 30% RRR was obtained (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.46, P=0.009). In Study 2, no significant results were obtained. However, there was a trend in favour of add-on 1 mg dose xaliproden vs. placebo (RRR 15% [-6.31, ns] for time to VC<50%; RRR 12% [CI: -6.27, ns] for time to VC<50% or DTP). Adjusted RR ratios were consistently more favourable for the xaliproden groups. Tolerability was good, and dose-dependent side effects were largely associated with the serotonergic properties of xaliproden. An effect of xaliproden on functional parameters, especially VC, was noted. Although this effect did not reach statistical significance, xaliproden had a small effect on clinically noteworthy aspects of disease progression in ALS."

We report the safety and functional efficacy results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study of xaliproden, a non-peptidic compound with growth factor activities, in 54 ALS patients treated for up to 32 weeks. In order to overcome the interference of mortality with functional assessment in exploratory studies, we identified from our ALS database prognostic factors to establish a staging process for selection pf patients: age, disease duration, slopes of deterioration of the functional scores calculated during the two months prior to the inclusion, and the value at entry of the forced vital capacity (FVC). The six months intent-to-treat analysis showed no statistically significant effect but a trend in favour of 2 mg xaliproden compared to placebo for reduction in the rate of deterioration of FVC, limbs functional score, and manual muscle testing score (MMT). The results in the completer analysis showed a significant 43% slower rate of deterioration in FVC (P=0.046) in xaliproden-treated patients but not in functional and MMT scores. These results support the use of a staging process to select suitable patients for phase II studies, and suggest that xaliproden may have potential effects in ALS and deserve further study."

The clinical manifestations can vary widely, from stillbirth to renal and major respiratory dysplasia to almost normal children. The current study included a total of 3 patients. The findings included clinical characteristics, diagnostics, therapy, and clinical outcomes. All patients were diagnosed with congenital aplasia of the abdominal wall and a variety of urogenital malformations. Cryptorchidism and a mega-bladder were observed in 2 patients and distinctive renal malformations, such as renal dysplasia, were observed in 1 patient. Treatment varies but usually includes surgical management of symptoms. One patient required urgent urinary surgery; a vesicotomy was urgently performed due to anuria. These aspects explain the great diversity of opinions on the approach to this syndrome, but the severity of renal dysplasia is the main prognostic factor. Two newborns died a few days later due to severe renal failure. Despite these concerns, many patients with PBS report being in physical and mental health and having a good quality of life."

The etiology of PBS is largely unresolved, but genetic factors are implicated given its recurrence in families. We examined cases of PBS to identify novel pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs). A total of 34 cases (30 males and 4 females) with PBS identified from all live births in New York State (1998-2005) were genotyped using Illumina HumanOmni2.5 microarrays. CNVs were prioritized if they were absent from in-house controls, encompassed \u226510 consecutive probes, were \u226520\u00a0Kb in size, had \u226420% overlap with common variants in population reference controls, and had \u226420% overlap with any variant previously detected in other birth defect phenotypes screened in our laboratory. We identified 17 candidate autosomal CNVs; 10 cases each had one CNV and four cases each had two CNVs. The CNVs included a 158\u00a0Kb duplication at 4q22 that overlaps the BMPR1B gene; duplications of different sizes carried by two cases in the intron of STIM1 gene; a 67\u00a0Kb duplication 202\u00a0Kb downstream of the NOG gene, and a 1.34\u00a0Mb deletion including the MYOCD gene. The identified rare CNVs spanned genes involved in mesodermal, muscle, and urinary tract development and differentiation, which might help in elucidating the genetic contribution to PBS. We did not have parental DNA and cannot identify whether these CNVs were de novo or inherited. Further research on these CNVs, particularly BMP signaling is warranted to elucidate the pathogenesis of PBS."

However, there is evidence that corticosteroid treatment results in muscle weakness and degeneration. This review, therefore, examines the available studies and addresses various possible mechanisms involved in the efficacy of prednisone therapy and amelioration of DMD. The progression of DMD is known to be associated with profound changes in structure, biochemistry and physiology of the affected muscles. It is hypothesized, therefore, that these very changes offer a fortunate set of circumstances, and it is owing to these alterations, as well as the well known anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive action of steroid, that muscles in DMD are rendered responsive resulting in significant improvement of muscle bulk and function."

Mitonchondrial complex I deficiency is a main cause of Leigh syndrome. In this study, a Chinese child with Leigh syndrome caused by 13513G>A mutation was reported. The proband was the first child of his parents. The previously healthy boy presented with generalized epilepsy at 12 years of age. When he visited Peking University First Hospital at 13 years of age, he had subacute loss of vision in two eyes and temporal defect of visual field in the left eye. He walked with a spastic gait. His blood lactate and pyruvate levels were elevated. Muscle biopsy showed mild lipid accumulation in muscle fiber. An electrocardiogram showed incomplete right bundle branch block. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral, symmetrical lesions in the basal ganglia, supporting the diagnosis of Leigh syndrome. 13513G>A mutation was identified by gene analysis in the patient, which led to mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I deficiency. Multivitamins and L-carnitine were administered. At present, the patient is 16 years old and has progressive deterioration with significant muscle weakness and body weight loss. He is absent from school. He has no obvious retardation in intelligence. 13513G>A mutation was first identified by gene analysis in Chinese population with Leigh syndrome. This may be helpful in genetic counseling."

Clinically, Leigh syndrome is characterized by a wide variety of abnormalities, from severe neurologic problems to a near absence of abnormalities. Most frequently the central nervous system is affected, with psychomotor retardation, seizures, nystagmus, ophthalmoparesis, optic atrophy, ataxia, dystonia, or respiratory failure. Some patients also present with peripheral nervous system involvement, including polyneuropathy or myopathy, or non-neurologic abnormalities, e.g., diabetes, short stature, hypertrichosis, cardiomyopathy, anemia, renal failure, vomiting, or diarrhea (Leigh-like syndrome). In the majority of cases, onset is in early childhood, but in a small number of cases, adults are affected. In the majority of cases, dysfunction of the respiratory chain (particularly complexes I, II, IV, or V), of coenzyme Q, or of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex are responsible for the disease. Associated mutations affect genes of the mitochondrial or nuclear genome. Leigh syndrome and Leigh-like syndrome are the mitochondrial disorders with the largest genetic heterogeneity."

Cumulative incidence of clinically relevant outcomes was stratified by genetic mutation type, exon mutation location, and extent of exon deletion. Of 436 males with DMD, 324 (74.3%) underwent genetic testing. Deletions were the most common mutation type (256, 79%), followed by point mutations (45, 13.9%) and duplications (23, 7.1%). There were 131 combinations of mutations with most mutations located along exons 45 to 52. The number of exons deleted varied between 1 and 52 with a median of 3 exons deleted (IQR 1-6).

Quantitative analysis of all exons of the gene and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification have brought about an improvement in mutation detection rate, as they will detect all exon scale deletions as well as duplications, widely used to detect exonic and intronic mutations.

The gene responsible for the Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy phenotype is located at Xp21 and its 427 kD protein product is called dystrophin. Deletions, point mutations and rarely duplications can occur almost anywhere in the DMD gene, which makes the molecular diagnosis difficult. Multiple polymerase chain reactions detect 95% of deletions in affected males [2, 4], but are not suitable for carrier detection in female relatives. Southern-blot analysis with six different cDNA probes covers the whole 14 kb dystrophin transcript and allows the detection of female carriers by comparing the intensity of the signals corresponding to the different exons. This method is time consuming compared to the newly introduced multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification method. Multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification is a method suitable for relative quantification of several DNA sequences in one reaction. The authors report results on 93 cases where the carrier status was analysed simultaneously by cDNA hybridisation and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification technique. In 42 cases the carrier state was confirmed and in this carrier population the authors additionally detected two cases with duplication, two cases with one copy of the whole dystrophin gene and three manifest carrier females. On the basis of these results the MLPA technique, which has been newly introduced in Hungary, proved to be a sensitive and quick method for the detection of carrier state in the DMD/BMD disease. Moreover, the exact deletion or duplication border can be detected and as a result, prediction on the phenotype can be given. This will provide the right therapeutic intervention for the affected patients in the future."

In DMD individuals under steroid treatment, GDF-8 levels increased as FSTN levels decreased, resembling the proportions of these proteins in healthy controls and also the baseline ratio of patients without steroids. GDF-8 and FSTN serum levels were also useful for carrier detection (p < 0.05).

Epigenetic mechanisms are becoming recognized as important factors implicated in the etiology and progression of various diseases. A growing number of genetic syndromes have been associated with unique genomic DNA methylation patterns (called \"episignatures\") that can be used for diagnostic testing and as disease biomarkers. To further investigate DMD pathophysiology, we assessed the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of peripheral blood from 36 patients with DMD using the combination of Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC bead chip array and EpiSign technology. We identified a unique episignature for DMD that whose specificity was confirmed in relation other neurodevelopmental disorders with known episignatures. By modeling the DMD episignature, we developed a new DMD episignature biomarker and provided novel insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this disorder, which have the potential to advance more effective, personalized approaches to DMD care."

The gene responsible for the Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy phenotype is located at Xp21 and its 427 kD protein product is called dystrophin. Deletions, point mutations and rarely duplications can occur almost anywhere in the DMD gene, which makes the molecular diagnosis difficult. Multiple polymerase chain reactions detect 95% of deletions in affected males [2, 4], but are not suitable for carrier detection in female relatives. Southern-blot analysis with six different cDNA probes covers the whole 14 kb dystrophin transcript and allows the detection of female carriers by comparing the intensity of the signals corresponding to the different exons. This method is time consuming compared to the newly introduced multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification method. Multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification is a method suitable for relative quantification of several DNA sequences in one reaction. The authors report results on 93 cases where the carrier status was analysed simultaneously by cDNA hybridisation and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification technique. In 42 cases the carrier state was confirmed and in this carrier population the authors additionally detected two cases with duplication, two cases with one copy of the whole dystrophin gene and three manifest carrier females. On the basis of these results the MLPA technique, which has been newly introduced in Hungary, proved to be a sensitive and quick method for the detection of carrier state in the DMD/BMD disease. Moreover, the exact deletion or duplication border can be detected and as a result, prediction on the phenotype can be given. This will provide the right therapeutic intervention for the affected patients in the future."

Cognitive and behavioral symptoms occur in about one third of patients, and it is important to recognize and manage them promptly, developing an individualized plan at school and at home to maximize the patient's cognitive abilities. In the late phase of the disease, palliative care is of paramount importance. Corticosteroid therapy (prednisone and deflazacort) is the only effective pharmacologic treatment for DMD. Daily prednisone treatment increases muscle strength and function, improves pulmonary function, and significantly slows the progression of weakness. Deflazacort has a similar effect on muscle strength, but it is not available in the United States. Treatment with corticosteroid should be offered to all patients with DMD, but the beneficial effects and potential adverse effects should be fully discussed before treatment begins. The optimal dose of prednisone is 0.75 mg/kg per day, up to a maximum of 40 mg/d. If adverse effects occur, a decrease in dosage is appropriate. Monitoring of muscle function and adverse effects by a neurologist or neuromuscular specialist is strongly recommended. Physical and occupational therapists should be involved early in the treatment of patients with DMD to develop a program that includes heel cord stretching and exercise. In the later phases, these therapists can recommend adaptive equipment and maximize independence. Orthopedic consultation is important in monitoring and managing scoliosis and joint contractures in the nonambulatory phase of the disease. Pulmonary evaluation for ventilatory care is important; pulmonary consultation is essential when vital capacity declines.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is not just a muscle disorder, but also a disease that affects the brain. The aim of the present study was to describe a case series of children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy that have also the presence of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). They have been assessed by means of standardized autism scales and the most appropriate psycho-educational treatment is herein discussed.\nMETHODS: In order to evaluate and identify the presence and intensity of autistic symptoms have been used the Childhood Autism Rating Scale and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule tools. Moreover, in order to assess the intelligence of subjects and their lower limb function, Wisch-R intelligence scale and Vignos function scale were used, respectively.\nRESULTS: Atypical behaviors included a preference for being alone, and selective interest in privileged objects used in a stereotyped manner, motor fretting, and attention instability were present in all children. By the administration of these scales was confirmed the presence of an autism spectrum disorders in all subjects.\nCONCLUSIONS: It is important for clinical practice to consider this association increased."

The following psychological tests were used to assess general intellectual functioning, academic achievement, incidence and nature of behavioral problems: The Wechsler Intelligence Scales, The Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised, The Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration, The Child Behavior Checklist, and The Conner's Parent Rating Scale. Twenty-four males were enrolled. The Wechsler Full Scale IQ was normally distributed with a mean of 95.6 (SD 23.3), which did not differ significantly from the population mean. The frequency of learning difficulties for reading was 21%, for spelling was 32%, and for arithmetic was 26%, significantly higher than the frequency in the general population.

Omaveloxolone, an Nrf2 activator, improves mitochondrial function, restores redox balance, and reduces inflammation in models of FA. We investigated the safety and efficacy of omaveloxolone in patients with FA.\nMETHODS: We conducted an international, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, registrational phase 2 trial at 11 institutions in the United States, Europe, and Australia (NCT02255435, EudraCT2015-002762-23). Eligible patients, 16 to 40\u2009years of age with genetically confirmed FA and baseline modified Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS) scores between 20 and 80, were randomized 1:1 to placebo or 150mg per day of omaveloxolone. The primary outcome was change from baseline in the mFARS score in those treated with omaveloxolone compared with those on placebo at 48\u2009weeks.\nRESULTS: One hundred fifty-five patients were screened, and 103 were randomly assigned to receive omaveloxolone (n = 51) or placebo (n = 52), with 40 omaveloxolone patients and 42 placebo patients analyzed in the full analysis set. Changes from baseline in mFARS scores in omaveloxolone (-1.55\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69) and placebo (0.85\u2009\u00b1\u20090.64) patients showed a difference between treatment groups of -2.40\u2009\u00b1\u20090.96 (p = 0.014). Transient reversible increases in aminotransferase levels were observed with omaveloxolone without increases in total bilirubin or other signs of liver injury.

It is caused by a GAA repeat expansion mutation within the frataxin gene (FXN). This impedes FXN transcription resulting in a progressive decrease of the mitochondrial protein, frataxin. Increased oxidative stress leading to a chronic depletion of endogenous antioxidants affects the survival of the cells and causes neurodegeneration. In particular, cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) show a significant increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and lower level of reduced glutathione (GSH). In FRDA, one of the major pathways of oxidant scavengers, the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, is defective. Previous studies on FRDA-like CGNs showed that the reduced level of frataxin and the oxidative stress induce mitochondrial impairments. By triggering the Nrf2 endogenous pathway pharmacologically we determined whether this could promote mitochondrial fitness and counteract oxidative stress. In this work, we sought to investigate the beneficial effect of a promising Nrf2-inducer, omaveloxolone (omav), in CGNs from two FRDA mouse models, KIKO and YG8R, and human fibroblasts from patients. We found that CGNs from both KIKO and YG8R presented Complex I deficiency and that omav was able to restore substrate availability and Complex I activity. This was also confirmed in human primary fibroblasts from FRDA patients. Although fibroblasts are not the major tissue affected, we found that they show significant differences recapitulating the disease; this is therefore an important tool to investigate patients' pathophysiology. Interestingly, we found that patient fibroblasts had an increased level of endogenous lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial ROS (mROS), and lower GSH at rest. Omav was able to reverse this phenotype, protecting the cells against oxidative stress. By stimulating the cells with hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and looking for potential"

To define the molecular basis of PKU, we characterized twelve restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotypes of the PAH locus in the northern European population and observed that 90% of the PKU alleles in this population are confined to four common RFLP haplotypes. We have recently reported a splicing mutation in the PAH gene that is associated with RFLP haplotype 3 which is present at about 40% of mutant alleles. We now report the molecular lesion associated with the RFLP haplotype 2 mutant allele. This defect is caused by a C-to-T transition in exon 12 resulting in an amino-acid substitution (Arg to Trp) at residue 408 of PAH.

Overall, approximately 90% or more EDS patients suffer from chronic pain. There are no existing guidelines to manage chronic pain in EDS patients. In this article, we illustrate 2 case reports of EDS patients with chronic pain and review the relevant literature regarding the pathological considerations and management of chronic pain in EDS.\nPATIENT CONCERNS: Our first patient had worsening multiple joint pains despite treatment with medications and a recent diagnosis of EDS-type 3. The second patient had a complicated history including longstanding EDS and multiple previous surgeries. She was referred due to concern about complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) in her upper extremity.\nDIAGNOSES: For the first patient, apart from chronic pain due to her EDS, her history also revealed that she suffered from kinesiophobia. For the second patient, a detailed clinical assessment revealed no signs of CRPS but instead a generalized worsening of EDS symptoms.\nINTERVENTIONS: Both patients were evaluated by the multidisciplinary team consisting of a pain physician, nurse, pain psychologist, and a kinesiologist.

Clinicians focus on a conservative multidisciplinary approach in patients with EDS, which avoids surgical interventions and its accompanying risks of morbidity and mortality. The multidisciplinary approach includes physiotherapy, occupational therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and pharmacologic interventions to decrease pain. This review identifies literature examining the components of this conservative multidisciplinary approach and their effectiveness across the PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Trip databases, using the terms \"Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome AND Pain Management\" that was then subsequently evaluated. The evaluation of this current literature provides weak evidence to support the efficacy of the individual components of the conservative multidisciplinary approach. Lack of alternative approaches leaves medical providers with little choice but to suggest these pain control methods, despite low-grade evidence of weak evidence of their efficacy. More research into the pathophysiology of chronic pain in EDS could help identify additional modes and rationales for therapy."

Of the various types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome the most severe is type IV (EDS IV). Early studies showed that fibroblasts from EDS IV patients secreted lower than normal amounts of type III procollagen (Pope et al., 1975). Later, the disease was linked to COL3A1, the gene encoding this protein. More recently, with the publication of full length cDNA and partial characterisation of the gene structure, detailed analysis of mutations in EDS IV patients has become possible. Nineteen different mutations in the type III procollagen gene have been reported in different families with EDS IV. Recent results support the hypothesis that in EDS IV, dominant inheritance should be assumed, in sporadic cases also, unless proven otherwise.

The International EDS Consortium proposes a revised EDS classification, which recognizes 13 subtypes. For each of the subtypes, we propose a set of clinical criteria that are suggestive for the diagnosis. However, in view of the vast genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic variability of the EDS subtypes, and the clinical overlap between EDS subtypes, but also with other HCTDs, the definite diagnosis of all EDS subtypes, except for the hypermobile type, relies on molecular confirmation with identification of (a) causative genetic variant(s). We also revised the clinical criteria for hypermobile EDS in order to allow for a better distinction from other joint hypermobility disorders. To satisfy research needs, we also propose a pathogenetic scheme, that regroups EDS subtypes for which the causative proteins function within the same pathway. We hope that the revised International EDS Classification will serve as a new standard for the diagnosis of EDS and will provide a framework for future research purposes. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) may be useful in augmenting the screening and diagnosis of CFRD, as well as guiding and monitoring its management.

There is currently limited evidence regarding both the global epidemiology of CF and access to this transformative therapy - and therefore where needs are not being met. Therefore, this study aims to define gaps in access to CF treatment.\nMETHODS: Patient data were extracted from established CF registries. Where these were not available, literature searches were conducted alongside an international survey of 51 CF experts to determine the diagnosed patient population. National CF prevalence estimates were combined with registry data on estimated population coverage, to extrapolate the total estimated number of undiagnosed patients. Estimates of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor treatment coverage were extracted from publicly available sales summaries and pricing data.\nRESULTS: 162,428 [144,606-186,620] people are estimated to be living with CF across 94 countries. Of these, an estimated 105,352 (65%) are diagnosed, with 19,516 (12%) receiving triple combination therapy. We estimated 57,076 patients with undiagnosed CF. Owing to a paucity of high-quality data, estimates of undiagnosed CF in low- and middle-income countries are highly uncertain. Patient registries were available in 45 countries, and used to identify 90% of the estimated diagnosed population.\nCONCLUSIONS: A significant CF patient burden exists in countries where disease-modifying drugs are unavailable, and final figures are likely underestimates. This analysis shows the potential to improve rates of diagnosis and treatment for CF, so a higher percentage of patients receive the most effective triple combination treatment."

Pulmonary complications of CF, which are the most morbid aspects of the disease, are caused by primary abnormalities in epithelial cells that lead to impaired mucociliary clearance. One potential therapeutic strategy is to reconstitute expression of the CF gene in airway epithelia by somatic gene transfer. To this end, we have developed an animal model of the human airway using bronchial xenografts and have tested the efficiency of in vivo retroviral gene transfer. Using the LacZ reporter gene, we find the efficiency of in vivo retroviral gene transfer to be dramatically dependent on the regenerative and mitotic state of the epithelium. Within an undifferentiated regenerating epithelium in which 40% of nuclei labeled with BrdU, 5-10% retroviral gene transfer was obtained. In contrast, no gene transfer was noted in a fully differentiated epithelium in which 1% of nuclei labeled with BrdU. These findings suggest that retroviral mediated gene transfer to the airway in vivo may be feasible if the proper regenerative state can be induced."

The prevalence of CFRD progressively increases from 9% below the age of 10 years to 43% above the age of 30 years, with reported annual age-dependent incidence rates ranging from 4% to 9%. The onset of CFRD is insidious and annual screening using the standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) from the age of 10 years has been recommended. However, OGTT thresholds for the diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance and CFRD were derived from epidemiological studies of non-CF patients and it is uncertain whether they are appropriate for patients with CF. The ability of OGTT alone to detect early abnormalities in blood glucose regulation has been questioned. Continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) may augment the screening and diagnosis of CFRD, as well as guide and monitor its management. Subcutaneous insulin therapy is currently recommended for the treatment of CFRD. Early use of insulin therapy might improve weight gain and lung function of CF patients, including those with normal OGTT results. It is still not clear when insulin therapy should be started, possibly reflecting the difficulties in detecting early but clinically relevant abnormalities in blood glucose metabolism among CF patients.

To date, the genetic background of the hypermobility type of EDS remains unclear, although some new insights have been gained recently. MFS is an autosomal-dominant disorder that affects the cardiovascular, ocular and skeletal system with aortic root dilation/dissection, ectopia lentis and bone overgrowth, respectively. Advances in therapeutic, mainly surgical, techniques have improved median survival significantly, yet severe morbidity and a substantial risk for premature mortality remain associated.

They are complex and multisystem diseases, with the majority being highly disabling because of major joint problems and neurosensory deficiencies, and in some cases, they may be life-threatening due to associated complications, especially vascular disorders.

Fourteen different types of EDS are recognized, of which the molecular cause is known for 13 types. These types are caused by variants in 20 different genes, the majority of which encode the fibrillar collagen types I, III and V, modifying or processing enzymes for those proteins, and enzymes that can modify glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans. For the hypermobile type of EDS, the molecular underpinnings remain unknown. As connective tissue is ubiquitously distributed throughout the body, manifestations of the different types of EDS are present, to varying degrees, in virtually every organ system. This can make these disorders particularly challenging to diagnose and manage.

This region is governed by genomic imprinting, a phenomenon in which genes are expressed exclusively from one parental allele. The genomic imprinting of the 15q11-q13 locus is established in the germline and is largely controlled by a bipartite imprinting centre. One part, termed the Prader-Willi syndrome imprinting center (PWS-IC), comprises a CpG island that is unmethylated on the paternal allele and methylated on the maternal allele. The second part, termed the Angelman syndrome imprinting centre, is required to silence the PWS_IC in the maternal germline. The loss of the paternal contribution of the imprinted 15q11-q13 locus most frequently occurs owing to a large deletion of the entire imprinted region but can also occur through maternal uniparental disomy or an imprinting defect. While PWS is considered a contiguous gene syndrome based on large-deletion and uniparental disomy patients, the lack of expression of only non-coding RNA transcripts from the SNURF-SNRPN/SNHG14 may be the primary cause of PWS. Patients with small atypical deletions of the paternal SNORD116 cluster alone appear to have most of the PWS related clinical phenotypes. The loss of the maternal contribution of the 15q11-q13 locus causes a separate and distinct condition called Angelman syndrome. Importantly, while much has been learned about the regulation and expression of genes and transcripts deriving from the 15q11-q13 locus, there remains much to be learned about how these genes and transcripts contribute at the molecular level to the clinical traits and developmental aspects of PWS that have been observed."

There are multiple genetic causes, although all ultimately involve the loss of paternally derived gene expression of chromosome region 15q11-q13. Multiple imprinted genes expressed only from the paternal allele have been identified in the specific region of human chromosome 15q associated with Prader-Willi syndrome and in the syntenic mouse chromosome 7C region, including a novel polycistronic gene (SNURF-SNRPN) that encodes two independent proteins. The latter genetic locus may play a key role in Prader-Willi syndrome and the evolution of imprinting in this domain, because it is uniquely involved with mutations in the imprinting process and balanced translocations in this syndrome. Indeed, based on the co-localization of SNURF and SNRPN within the imprinting control region critical to Prader-Willi syndrome, evolutionary arguments would suggest that this genetic locus is a prime candidate for mutations producing the failure-to-thrive phenotype of neonates with this syndrome and of corresponding mouse models. Hence, the SNURF-SNRPN gene may encode a paternally derived postnatal growth factor."

The basic defect appears to be the absence of function of genes that are normally expressed in a monoallelic fashion only from the paternal chromosome. In 60-70% of patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, the genetic defect is a deletion in the area of 15q11-13 on the paternal chromosome. A further 25-30% of patients with Prader-Willi syndrome do not have paternal deletions, the defect being due to uniparental disomy (UPD) for maternal chromosome 15. Paternal deletions and maternal UPD are functionally equivalent, as they both result in the absence of a paternal contribution to the genome in the 15q11-13 region. The SNRPN (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated polypeptide N) gene has a critical role in the 15q11-13 region, as it is probably part of the putative imprinting centre that regulates the expression of several genes in the Prader-Willi syndrome transcriptional domain. Two further rare causes of Prader-Willi syndrome are imprinting mutations, which are microdeletions or point mutations in the putative imprinting control region, and translocations with their breakpoints in the Prader-Willi syndrome region."

Obesity and the behavioural problems are the major causes of morbidity and mortality. Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by abnormalities of the imprinted region of proximal 15q and results from absence of the normally active paternal genes in this region. Such absence results from paternal interstitial deletion, maternal uniparental disomy, or a mutation or other abnormality in the imprinting process. Diagnostic identification of all causes has become available in recent years, permitting early detection and institution of appropriate management.

In the present report, we describe a female patient with complex maternal uniparental trisomy for the 15q11-q13 Prader-Willi syndrome critical region due to a de novo interstitial duplication of 15q11-q13 region that is present in one of the maternal homologs. As a result, the patient has three maternally derived copies of the Prader-Willi syndrome critical region and absence of paternal 15 contribution and thus, presents with a Prader-Willi syndrome phenotype with risk for developing additional phenotypes (e.g., autism and psychiatric phenotypes) characteristic of maternally derived duplications of this region. We suggest that this is a rather unique mechanism leading to Prader-Willi syndrome that has not been previously reported."

            "response": "Current approaches for gene therapy for PKU include the use of viral vectors such as adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) and lentiviruses (LVs) to deliver the PAH gene to liver cells, as well as non-viral methods such as naked DNA and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing mRNA. Additionally, gene editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9 are being explored for the treatment of PKU.\n\nQuestion: What are the challenges of current dietary treatment for PKU?\n\nAnswer: Current dietary treatment for PKU has several challenges, including the need for lifelong dietary restriction of phenylalanine, which can be difficult for patients to adhere to, particularly as they get older. Additionally, dietary treatment may not completely normalize blood phenylalanine levels, and some patients may experience neurological and behavioral problems despite treatment.\n\nQuestion: What are the potential benefits of gene therapy for PKU?\n\nAnswer: Gene therapy for PKU has the potential to provide a long-term or permanent correction of the disease, eliminating the need for dietary restriction and potentially improving the quality of life for patients. Additionally, gene therapy may be able to normalize blood phenylalanine levels more effectively than dietary treatment, which could reduce the risk of neurological and behavioral problems.\n\nQuestion: What are the current clinical trials for PKU gene therapy?\n\nAnswer: There are several ongoing and planned clinical trials for PKU gene therapy, including trials using AAV vectors, LV vectors, and gene editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9. These trials are designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of gene therapy for PKU and to determine the optimal approach for treating the disease.\n\nQuestion: What is the role of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) in PKU gene therapy?\n\nAnswer: Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a cofactor required for the activity of the PAH enzyme. In PKU gene therapy, BH4 is often provided as a supplement or through gene therapy to ensure that the PAH enzyme is functional. This is particularly important when using skeletal muscle as a target for gene therapy, as BH4 is not naturally present in muscle cells.",

Alternative therapies under investigation include, among others, the use of gene therapy to provide copies of wild-type, non-mutant, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme. Expression of PAH in both liver (the usual metabolic source of this enzyme) and skeletal muscle is under investigation. Liver gene therapy, using a viral vector based on the adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), provided effective clearance of serum Phe that was sustained for 1 year in some mice. In order for PAH expression to be effective in skeletal muscle, the essential metabolic cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), must also be provided, either by supplementation or gene therapy. Both these approaches were effective. When transgenic PKU mice that constitutively expressed PAH in muscle were given intraperitoneal supplementation with BH(4), this produced (transient) effective clearance of Phe to normal levels. In addition, use of an AAV vector containing the genes for PAH, and for two key synthetic enzymes for BH(4), provided substantial and long-lasting correction (more than 1 year) of blood Phe levels when injected into skeletal muscle of PKU mice. These two strategies provide promising treatment alternatives for the management of PKU in patients."

To explore a long-term nondietary restriction treatment, a somatic gene transfer approach in a PKU mouse model (C57Bl/6-Pahenu2) was employed to examine its preclinical feasibility. A recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector containing the murine Pah-cDNA was generated, pseudotyped with capsids from AAV serotype 8, and delivered into the liver of PKU mice via single intraportal or tail vein injections. The blood Phe concentrations decreased to normal levels (< or =100 microM or 1.7 mg/dl) 2 weeks after vector application, independent of the sex of the PKU animals and the route of application. In particular, the therapeutic long-term correction in females was also dramatic, which had previously been shown to be difficult to achieve. Therapeutic ranges of Phe were accompanied by the phenotypic reversion from brown to black hair. In treated mice, PAH enzyme activity in whole liver extracts reversed to normal and neither hepatic toxicity nor immunogenicity was observed. In contrast, a lentiviral vector expressing the murine Pah-cDNA, delivered via intraportal vein injection into PKU mice, did not result in therapeutic levels of blood Phe. This study demonstrates the complete correction of hyperphenylalaninemia in both males and females with a rAAV serotype 8 vector.

Patients show a normal neonatal period with subsequent developmental regression and a loss of acquired skills (communication and motor skills), deceleration of head growth, and development of typical hand stereotypies. Recent studies have shown that mutations in the X-linked methyl CpG binding protein 2 gene (MeCP2) cause most typical cases of Rett syndrome. The MeCP2 gene encodes a protein that binds methylated cytosine residues of CpG dinucleotides and mediates, with histone deacetylases and transcriptional repressors, the transcription \"silencing\" of other genes. Girls with Rett syndrome exhibit mosaic expression for the MeCP2 defect at the cellular level, with most patients showing random X-inactivation and approximately equal numbers of cells expressing the normal MeCP2 gene and the mutated MeCP2 gene. In rare cases, females with a MeCP2 mutation escape phenotypic expression of the disorder because of nonrandom X-inactivation and the preferential inactivation of the mutated MeCP2 allele. Nonrandom patterns of X-inactivation may also contribute to the clinical variability often seen in girls with Rett syndrome. The spectrum of clinical phenotype caused by MeCP2 mutations is wide, including milder \"preserved speech\" variants, the severe congenital Rett variant, and a subset of X-linked recessive mental retardation in boys. Studies have shown that atypical and classical Rett syndrome can caused by the same MeCP2 mutations, indicating clinical phenotype is variable even among girls with the same MeCP2 mutation. The relationship between type of MeCP2 mutation, X-inactivation status, and clinical phenotype of Rett syndrome is complex and likely involves other environmental and polygenic modifiers."

                    "text": "Rett syndrome is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder primarily affecting girls. About 80% of classic Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene for methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCP2) in Xq28. MeCP2 links DNA methylation to transcriptional repression, and MECP2 mutations likely cause partial or complete loss of function of the protein, leading to inappropriate transcription of downstream genes at critical times in brain development. More severe and milder variant forms can all be caused by similar mutations. Most classic Rett syndrome patients have random X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), but skewed patterns are present in a few. All asymptomatic or mildly mentally delayed female carriers studied to date have non-random XCI patterns, suggesting that this attenuates the deleterious effects of the MECP2 mutations in these women. The finding of non-random XCI patterns in some patients with very early truncations is consistent with this observation and supports that many mutations could cause partial and not complete loss of function. Our observation that the mutant mRNA is stable in three patients with truncating mutations supports this possibility. Further studies will have to be performed to better understand the functional consequences of MECP2 mutations in RTT."

                    "text": "Rett syndrome is caused by mutation in MECP2, a gene located on Xq28 and subject to X-inactivation. MECP2 encodes methyl CpG-binding protein 2, a widely expressed transcriptional repressor of methylated DNA. Mutations in MECP2 are primarily de novo events in the male germ line and thus lead to an excess of affected females. Here we report the identification of a unique 47,XXX girl with relatively mild atypical Rett syndrome leading initially to a diagnosis of infantile autism with regression. Mutation analysis of the MECP2 gene identified a de novo MECP2 mutation, L100V. Examination of a panel of X-linked microsatellite markers indicated that her supernumerary X chromosome is maternally derived. X-inactivation patterns were determined by analysis of methylation of the androgen receptor locus, and indicated preferential inactivation of her paternal allele. The parental origin of her MECP2 mutation could not be determined because she was uninformative for intronic polymorphisms flanking her mutation. This is the first reported case of sex chromosome trisomy and MECP2 mutation in a female, and it illustrates the importance of allele dosage on the severity of Rett syndrome phenotype."

                    "text": "In 1999, mutations in the MECP2 gene were identified as the primary cause of Rett syndrome. MECP2 mutations can be found in 70% to 80% of all clinically defined Rett syndrome cases; in classic Rett syndrome, this frequency is even higher. In most cases, missense and nonsense mutations affecting functionally important domains can be found. Additionally, a hot spot for small deletions has been defined, and several gross rearrangements have also been described. Among female individuals with Rett syndrome, the spectrum of clinical phenotypes is broad, but most fulfill the diagnostic criteria. In contrast, male individuals with mutations in the MECP2 gene are rare, and only a minority have clinical symptoms resembling Rett syndrome."
